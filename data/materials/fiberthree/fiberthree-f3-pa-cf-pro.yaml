      Filament for FFF-printers with major PA 6 content
      15 weight-% carbon fiber
      very high tensile strength; moderate water absorption
      low warping effect
      excellent adhesion to various print plates
      matt black surface finish


  Technical filament from polyamide modified for 3D-printing in FFF with additional carbon fibers. The carbon fibers reduce the shrinkage and the warping behaviour extremely.
  Material Properties
  Material shows superior strength with remaining impact resistance. Recommended for all high-strength parts with good heat- and media resistance.
  Printed parts show an attractive matte surface finish.
  Printed parts with thin wall layers can become very flexible under high humidity intake - in this case we recommend F3 PA-CF Lite.
  The material differs from F3 PA-CF Lite in higher tensile strength, better printability and more sensitivity towards moisture.
  The stiffness of the filament should be considered for the pipes and the feeder system of the printer to avoid breaking.
  Handling Notes
  The use of wear-resistant nozzles is highly recommended.
  The material has to be kept dry for reliable print results under all conditions.
