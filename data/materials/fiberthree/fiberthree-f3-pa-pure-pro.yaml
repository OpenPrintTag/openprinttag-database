      Filament for FFF-printers with major PA 6 content
      unfilled
      high tensile strength & moderate water absorption
      low warping effect
      excellent adhesion to various print plates
      very smooth surfaces possible (bone white color)


  Technical filament from polyamide modified for 3D-printing in FFF.
  Material Properties
  Material shows nearly similar strength for injection-molded or printed parts by the good layer adhesion with highly reduced warping behaviour.
  Recommended for all high strength parts with good heat- and media resistance.
  The material can be used as a baseline for comparison of the fiber addition impact or where fibers or conductivity is not wanted in the printed part.
  The material differs from PA PureLite by less heat absorption in the melting process and a lightly increased moisture sensitivity.
  Handling Notes
  Printed parts show an excellent smooth surface finish.
  The material differs from F3 PA-CF Pro/ GF Pro as it is unfilled.
  The material has to be kept dry for reliable print results under all conditions.
