      ①【Glow in the Dark PLA】SUNLU glow in the dark PLA filament contains phosphorescent materials, which can glow in the dark after absorbing light energy. If it is exposed to UV lights, the luminous effect will be better.

      ②【1.75mm Filament Diameter】Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0.02mm. SUNLU filament has wide compatibility due to the small diameter error, it's suitable for almost all 1.75mm FDM 3D printers.

      ③【SUNLU Spool Diameter】Spool Diameter: 8.00", Spool Width: 2.50", Spool Hub Hole Diameter: 2.20". The size of the SUNLU filament spool is suitable for hanging on a lot of FDM 3D printers.

      ④【Recommend Settings】We recommend printing at a nozzle temperature of 200-210°C, bed temperature of 50-65°C, printing speed of 50-100mm/s.

      ⑤【Neatly Wound 3D Filament Spool】SUNLU's self-developed neat winding device ensures that the filament is easy to use, with a 100% neat rate that reduces the risk of tangles and jams, and provides a smoother and more efficient 3D printing experience.

      ⑥【SUNLU Main 3D Products】SUNLU offers a wide range of high-quality 3D printing products, including 3D printer filament, filament dryer, FDM 3D printer, 3D pen, 3D pen filament, 3D printer resin, LCD 3D printer, resin curing box, and other accessories, providing you with everything you need for a successful 3D printing experience.
