      ①【Toughness Enhanced PLA PLUS】SUNLU PLA+ filament is a toughened version of regular PLA filament. Its toughness can reach more than 11 times of PLA filament. The optimized PLA Plus filament can meet your demands for high-toughness printing projects.

      ②【Neatly Wound Filament】 SUNLU independently developed the 3D filament neatly lined up, using the machine to automatically neatly wind the wire to ensure that the filament comes out neatly during the printing process, reducing the risk of printing failure.

      ③【Dimensional Accuracy & Consistency】SUNLU has strict production process and diameter control equipment to ensure that the tough PLA filament have accurate diameter tolerance. Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0.02mm. 1 kg spool (2.2lbs).

      ④【Clog-Free&Bubble-Free】Full mechanical winding and strict manual multiple quality inspection(24-hour drying&vacuum sealed), which guarantee SUNLU PLA+ filament easy to be fed and with better adhesion layer.

      ⑤【Easy to Use】SUNLU is capable of manufacturing all kinds of filaments in large scale with premium quality, which contribute to SUNLU 3D filament cost-effective and reliable for 99% FDM 3D printers.

      ⑥【Professional after-sales team】SUNLU is a high-tech enterprise specializing in R&D, production and sales of 3D printing filament, 3D printer, 3D pen and 3D resin. We will help you whenever you need. Choose SUNLU to make your purchase risk-free.
