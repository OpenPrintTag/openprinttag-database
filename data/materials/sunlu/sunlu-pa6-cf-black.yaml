description: "  \n    [Stiff & Strong & Heat Resistant] - SUNLU PA6-CF nylon filament 1.75mm is made of 80% PA and 20% Carbon Fibers. The carbon fiber reinforcement really provides significantly improved stiffness, strength and heat resistance with outstanding layer adhesion.\n\n    [Good for Industrial Engineering Printing] - SUNLU PA6-CF is very strong, durable and features an excellent heat resistance, the models printed with Carbon Fiber Nylon Filament can be used in many industrial fields. It can be used in applications requiring torsional, tensile, and impact strength. Such as gears, screws, helmets, fan blades, toy car chassis, skateboard parts, bicycle frames, etc.\n\n    [Heat-Resistant]-The heat distortion temperature is up to 209degreesC, much higher than Easy PA, PC, ASA and other 3D printing filaments. It can be applied to parts that need to withstand high temperatures, such as automobile exhaust pipes, motor covers, pot handles, the bottom of the kettle, etc.\n\n    [Printing Setting] - Nozzle: 270-290; Bed Temperature: 50-70; Speed: 50mm/s - 150mm/s; Annealing: 80~130 5-12h (To ensure a good heat resistance of your printed part it is recommended to anneal your print model); Bed Surface: almost any surface with a thin coat of PVA glue or Magigoo PA\n\n    [Notes] - \x01Drying is required before printing. Recommended drying conditions are: 80degreesC for 24 hours or 110degreesC for 4 hours. \x02Printing PA6-CF with copper spray is susceptible to abrasion, and we recommend using abrasion-resistant nozzles such as those made of hardened steel.\n\n    [1.75mm Diameter]- Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0.03mm. SUNLU filament has wide compatibility due to the small diameter error, it's suitable for most 1.75mm FDM 3D printers.\n\n    [Strong compatibility]- SUNLU 3D Filament is not only applicable to all SUNLU 3D printing products: FDM 3D Printer, 3D Printer Accessories, Filament Dyer, but also applicable to almost all FDM 3D printers of other brands. For example: bambu/Ender 3/Ender 3V2, etc.\n\n    [Vacuum Packed]-SUNLU 3D printer filaments are all vacuum sealed and come with a desiccant pack. Vacuum packing, dustproof and protect the filament dry, avoid absorbing moisture during transportation. Guaranteed to deliver the best printing effect of the filament to the hands of customers.\n\n    [After Sales Guarantee] -SUNLU, founded in 2013, is a high-tech company dedicated to research and development, production and sales of 3D printing filaments, 3D printers and various 3D printing materials such as PLA, PETG, 3d resin etc. We are committed to making ongoing and exceptional contributions to the 3D printing industry.\n\n"
