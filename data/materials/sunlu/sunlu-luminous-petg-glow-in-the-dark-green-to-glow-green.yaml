      ①【Glow in the Dark PETG】SUNLU glow in the dark PETG filament contains phosphorescent materials, which can glow in the dark after absorbing light energy. If it is exposed to UV lights, the luminous effect will be better.

      ②【Pecfect for Festivals and Parties】SUNLU PETG glow filaments can be made into prints that glow at night, which is very suitable for printing decorations for party and Parties.

      ③【Better Function, More Creativity】SUNLU PETG 3D Printer Filament combines the advantages of both PLA and ABS 3D printer filament, making 3D printing more convenient and easy.

      ④【Excellent Layer Adhesion】PETG filament offers excellent layer adhesion, reducing the risks of warping and ensuring smooth, strong prints with great structural integrity.

      ⑤【High Impact Strength】With its high impact resistance, PETG is perfect for printing parts that need to endure bumps and drops, ensuring long-lasting performance without cracks or breaks.

      ⑥【Robust Durability】PETG prints are robust and maintain their properties over time, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications where weather resistance is a necessity.

      ⑦【Less Stringing & No Blocking】SUNLU PETG filament is specially engineered to reduce stringiness and eliminate clogging, ensuring a smooth and consistent print every time.
