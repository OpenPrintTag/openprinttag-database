      【SUNLU Carbon Fiber PETG Filament】- SUNLU PETG-CF 3D printer filament is reinforced with 10% carbon fiber to increase the strength of PETG while maintaining its impact resistance.

      【High Impact Strength】- With its high impact resistance, PETG is perfect for printing parts that need to endure bumps and drops, ensuring long-lasting performance without cracks or breaks.

      【Heat-Resistant】- The heat distortion temperature is up to 130°C. PETG-CF improved and temperature resistance while maintaining the impact resistance characteristic of PETG Filament.

      【Robust Durability】- PETG prints are robust and maintain their properties over time, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications where weather resistance is a necessity.

      【Less Stringing & No Blocking】- SUNLU PETG filament is specially engineered to reduce stringiness and eliminate clogging, ensuring a smooth and consistent print every time.

      【Frosted Matte Texture】- Newly introduced carbon fiber PETG filament. Designed for matte effect printing. Ideal for creations that require a sophisticated and flawless look.

      【1.75mm Diameter】- Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0.03mm. SUNLU filament has wide compatibility due to the small diameter error, it's suitable for most 1.75mm FDM 3D printers.

      【PETG Recommend Settings】- We recommend printing the PETG-CF filament at a nozzle temperature of 240-250°C, bed temperature of 50-70°C, printing speed of 50-150mm/s.

      【Wide Compatibility】- SUNLU PETG filament has a diameter accuracy of +/-0.03mm, small diameter error, wide compatibility, and can be used on various common 3D printers.

      【SUNLU Main 3D Products】- SUNLU offers a wide range of high-quality 3D printing products, including 3D printing filaments, 3D printers and various materials.
