      【Read Before Your Buying】- This filament is made from recycled materials, not raw ones. Its color may not be as bright, but if used within six months, the printing quality will remain similar.

      【SUNLU Recycled 3D Printer Filament】- 'Recycled Filament' does not refer to reusing second-hand filaments, but rather to repurposing semi-finished filaments not produced as planned during manufacturing.

      【High Quality PLA Filament】- PLA 3D Printer filaments have the advantages of incredible printing quality, high purity with low shrinkage and superb layer bonding.

      【Easy to use】SUNLU PLA filament is reliable, versatile. No clogs, No bubbles, No tangles. Ideal for beginners and experienced users.

      【Neatly Wound Filament】SUNLU developed our own filament neatly lined up, which significantly reduces pauses in the printing process due to wire entanglement

      【1.75mm Dimensional Accuracy】3D Printer PLA filaments have strict tolerances. Diameter 1.75mm, dimensional accuracy +/- 0.02mm without any exaggeration.

      【Recommend Settings】- We recommend printing the PLA 3D filament at a nozzle temperature of 210-240℃, bed temperature of 50-60℃, printing speed of 100-200mm/s.

      【Cardboard Reel Filament】SUNLU 3D Filament 1.75mm packaging with fully recycled cardboard spool and box.Spool Diameter: 200mm, Spool Width: 67±2mm, Spool Hub Hole Diameter: 55mm.

      【Wide Compatibility】- SUNLU 3D Printer Filament has small diameter error, wide compatibility, and can be used on various common 3D printers.

      【SUNLU Main 3D Products】- SUNLU offers a wide range of high-quality 3D printing products, including 3D printing filaments, 3D printers and various materials.
