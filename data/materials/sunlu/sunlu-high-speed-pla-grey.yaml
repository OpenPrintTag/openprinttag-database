      ①【Print Faster】 -SUNLU high-speed 3D printer PLA filament, designed to turbocharge your printing from slow to swift. Experience a colossal 500% increase in flowability, ensuring smooth printing even at speeds exceeding 250mm/s, without clogs or filament shortages. Bring your ideas to life with high-speed printing, on average, save 70% printing time.

      ②【Efficient Cooling】 -High speed PLA filament boasts a 180% boost in heat dissipation, enabling quicker cooling and curing than regular PLA filament under the same conditions. This prevents 3d filament material buildup during fast prints, improving printing speed while also ensuring accuracy and mechanical performance.

      ③【High Speed PLA Printing Tips】 -The average printing temp of SUNLU High Speed PLA filament is lower than regular PLA filament, saving time and energy consumption. As HS PLA Filament is temperature-sensitive, please set slicing parameters according to recommended print speed and temp matching based on your 3D printer. If stringing occurs, please reduce print temp appropriately.

      ④【Clog-Free and Bubble-Free】 -SUNLU 3d printer PLA filament consistent diameter tolerance 1.75mm ±0.02mm, ensuring tangle-free and knot-free. Rigorous 24-hour pre-packaging drying, plus vacuum-sealing, guarantees moisture-free printing, eliminating clogs and bubbles. Increase your printing success rate.

      ⑤【After Sales Guarantee】 -SUNLU, founded in 2013, is a high-tech company dedicated to research and development, production and sales of 3D printing filaments, 3D printers and various 3D printing materials such as PLA, PETG, 3d resin etc. We are committed to making ongoing and exceptional contributions to the 3D printing industry.
