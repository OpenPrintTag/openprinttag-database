description: "  \n    \x01 [SUNLU ASA 3D Filament]ASA filament is kind of very strong and tough filament, stronger than PLA filament and ABS filament. No clog, no bubble, no tangle, good layer adhesion, easy to use.\n\n    \x02[Super Neat Filament Spool]Spool Diameter: 8.00\", Spool Width: 2.50\", Spool Hub Hole Diameter: 2.20\". The size of the SUNLU filament spool is suitable for hanging on a lot of FDM 3D printers.\n\n    \x03[UV/Rain/Heat Resistant]SUNLU ASA 3D printing filament is great for printing outdoor functional mechanical parts, UV/Rain/Heat highly resistant.\n\n    \x04[1.75mm Filament Diameter]Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0.02mm. SUNLU filament has wide compatibility due to the small diameter error, it's suitable for almost all 1.75mm FDM 3D printers.\n\n    \x05[Weight Upgrade] - SUNLU ASA filament has been converted to 1KG package, more weight, same price, more economical.\n\n    \x06[Recommend Settings]We recommend printing at a nozzle temperature of 230-260degreesC(446-500degreesF), bed temperature of 80-120degreesC(176-248degreesF), printing speed of 50-100mm/s.\n\n    \a[Vacuum Packaging]SUNLU 3D Printer Filaments are sealed in airtight vacuum packaging which ensures that they remain moisture-free and preserve their quality from the factory to your 3D printer.\n\n    \b[Multiple Color Sizes Available] - Provides multiple color size options to meet users' different printing needs, allowing users to choose based on preference and project requirements.\n\n    \t[SUNLU Service and Warranty] We have a professional team for 3D printer filaments. If there is any problem with the 3D filament, or any problem with the order or invoice, please let us know. We are always at your service.\n\n    \n[SUNLU Professional Team]SUNLU is a high-tech enterprise specializing in R&D, production and sales of 3D filament, 3D printer, 3D pen, filament dryer, 3D resin and resin UV light curing box.\n\n"
