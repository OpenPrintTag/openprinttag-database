description: " \x01[Big Roll ABS Filament]SUNLU ABS filaments launch 1.8KG large spool filaments, reducing the need for frequent replacement of filaments, improving production efficiency while reducing cost-effectiveness. \n\n    \x01 [Strong 3D Printing Filament ABS]- SUNLU ABS 3D filament is a type of strong and durable filament, ideal for printing durable items or functional parts that require higher heat resistance.\n\n    \x02 [Impact Resistance and Durable]- ABS filament can withstand long-term use without being prone to wear or damage, and is not prone to breakage or deformation when impacted or squeezed.\n\n    \x03 [Impact Strength and Toughness]- ABS filament can withstand a certain amount of pressure without being easily deformed or broken, and can resist surface damage such as friction and scratches, allowing the product to remain intact in appearance even after long-term use.\n\n    \x04 [Recommended Print Parameters]- Nozzle print temperature: 250-260, Print platform temperture: 80-100, Printing speed: 40-60mm/s, Retraction distance: 5mm, Retraction speed: 50mm/s. Compatible with most FDM 3D printers that can use a 1.75 mm 3D printer filament.\n\n    \x05 [Diameter Tolerance  0.02 mm]- The SUNLU ABS 1.75 mm 3D printer filament is manufactured with high precision work and therefore has a tolerance of only +/- 0.02 mm.\n\n    \x06 [Multiple Colors Are Available]- Provides multiple color options to meet different printing needs of users, allowing users to choose according to preference and project requirements.\n\n    \a [Compatible with 99% 3D Printers]- Compatible with most FDM 3D printers that can use 1.75mm 3D printer filament. The larger inner diameter of the filament spool makes unwinding easier.\n\n    \b [High Quality and Smooth Filament]- Quality Raw Materials, Smooth Printing, Good Adhesion, Less Stringing, Less Warping, No Bubble, No Tangle, friendly for beginners.\n\n    \t [SUNLU Service and Warranty]- We have a professional team for 3D printer filaments. If there is any problem with the 3D filament, or any problem with the order or invoice, please let us know. We are always at your service.\n\n    \n\n\n"
