      ①【PETG Filament 1.75mm】SUNLU PETG 3D Printer Filament combines the advantages of both PLA and ABS 3D printer filament, making 3D printing more convenient and easy.

      ②【Excellent Layer Adhesion】PETG filament offers excellent layer adhesion, reducing the risks of warping and ensuring smooth, strong prints with great structural integrity.

      ③【Enhanced Toughness】Known for its toughness, PETG outperforms many other filaments in durability, making it ideal for creating sturdy and resilient items that can withstand stress and use.

      ④【High Impact Strength】With its high impact resistance, PETG is perfect for printing parts that need to endure bumps and drops, ensuring long-lasting performance without cracks or breaks.

      ⑤【Robust Durability】PETG prints are robust and maintain their properties over time, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications where weather resistance is a necessity.

      ⑥【Less Stringing & No Blocking】SUNLU PETG filament is specially engineered to reduce stringiness and eliminate clogging, ensuring a smooth and consistent print every time.

      ⑦【PETG Recommend Settings】We recommend printing the PETG filament at a nozzle temperature of 220-230°C, bed temperature of 60-70°C, printing speed of 40-600mm/s.

      ⑧【Wide Compatibility】SUNLU PETG filament has a diameter accuracy of +/-0.02 mm, small diameter error, wide compatibility, and can be used on various common 3D printers.

      ⑨【Vacuum Packaging】SUNLU 3D Printer Filaments are sealed in airtight vacuum packaging which ensures that they remain moisture-free and preserve their quality from the factory to your 3D printer.

      ⑩【SUNLU Main 3D Products】SUNLU offers a variety of high-quality 3D printing products, including 3D printer filament, filament dryer, FDM 3D printer, 3D printer resin, LCD 3D printer, resin curing box and other accessories.
