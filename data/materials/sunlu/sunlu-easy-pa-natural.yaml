      NO CRACKS & ANTI-WARPING - Nylon 3d printer filament offers excellent printing quality with no cracks or warping. Neat SUNLU Filament ensures smoother print surface.

      HIGH PERFORMANCE NYLON - Nylon 3D printing filament has excellent mechanical properties. Perfecy for living hinges,functional parts,industrial parts,household parts.

      EASY PA PRINTING SETTINGS - Nozzle Printing Temperature:250-270, Printing Platform Temperature:30-50, Speed:60-150mm/s, Drying Temperature:70, Drying Time:48H

      HEAT RESISTANT PA - Heat resistance up to 121degreesC. Nylon filament Tools are ideal for high-temp applications, such as fuel dispensers, electronic surface mount devices.

      HIGH STRENGTH PA FILAMENT 1.75 - PA 3D filament resists damage from abrasion and friction, ensuring durability. Even if finished model is dropped, it won't crack.

      NYLON 3D PRINTER FILAMENT 1.75 - SUNLU PA filament is a copolymer of Nylon 6 and Nylon 6.6.Thermoplastic filament is ideal choice for engineering or prototyping.

      ANNEALING FOR EASY PA FILAMENT - Heating PA to the temperature(90-130degreesC) and then slowly cooling it to improved heat resistance, strength and better mechanical properties.

      EASY TO USE & UV RESISTANCE - Larger spool inner diameter makes feeding smoother. SUNLU Nylon Filament 1.75mm features uv-resistance, no brittleness or fading.

      SEAL & MOISTURE BARRIER - Vacuum packaging with aluminum foil bag offers superior sealing to prevent PA filament moisture. Please put PA back into vacuum bag after using.
