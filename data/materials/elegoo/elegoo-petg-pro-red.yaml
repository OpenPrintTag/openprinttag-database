  Easy to Print: ELEGOO PETG PRO filament strikes the perfect balance between PLA and ABS, making it incredibly easy to print like PLA while offering the similarly strength and durability of ABS.

  Excellent Dimensional Stability: Our PETG Pro filament boasts excellent dimensional stability with less warping and shrinkage, ensuring that your prints retain their intended shape and dimensions.

  0.02mm Dimensional Accuracy: Our PETG PRO filament provides a meticulous dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.02 mm, ensuring that your prints will come with excellent tolerance and consistency.


  Good Mechanical Performance: Our PETG Pro filament is engineered to deliver good toughness, strength, and outstanding impact strength, allowing it to withstand mechanical stress and accidental impacts.

  Less-Tangle & Neatly Wound: All PETG Pro filaments are neatly wound on eco-friendly cardboard spools. Fully mechanical winding with strict manual inspection minimizes possible tangles and knots.

  No Clogging or Bubbles: All filaments are completely dried before packing and vacuum sealed with desiccants to ensure the filaments remain dry and moisture-free, preventing clogs and bubbles during printing.
