  High-Speed Printing: Unlock the potential of rapid printing with ELEGOO RAPID PETG filament, as it supports high-speed printing of up to 600mm/s, allowing you to increase your productivity and efficiency.

  Easy to Print: Our RAPID PETG filament is engineered for ease of printing. With excellent flow characteristics and low warping, shrinkage, and deformation, it reduces potential print distortion and warping.

  Increased Rigidity: Our RAPID PETG filament boasts increased rigidity, making it ideal for structural prints that require added strength and stability, with good structural integrity.

  0.02mm Dimensional Accuracy: Our RAPID PETG filament features a dimensional accuracy of 0.02mm, ensuring your prints have remarkable accuracy and consistency.

  Less-Tangle & Neatly Wound: All filaments are fully mechanically wound on eco-friendly cardboard spools and undergo strict manual inspection to prevent tangles and knots for consistent performance.

  No Clogging & No Bubbles: Each spool is thoroughly dried before packing and vacuum-sealed with desiccants to protect the filament from dust and moisture, minimizing the risk of clogging or bubbles.
