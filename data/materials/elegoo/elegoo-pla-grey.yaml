  High-Quality PLA Filaments: Made from high-quality PLA, a commonly used thermoplastic material with a low melting temperature, low warpage and shrinkage, easy to print, odorless during printing, and provides a smooth surface finish.

  Accurate and Consistent Dimension: Strict tolerances ensure consistent dimension of the 1.75 mm PLA filament for smoother and more stable printing, with a dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.02 mm.

  Less-tangle & Eco-Friendly: Full mechanical winding with rigorous manual inspection ensures that the line is neatly arranged on the spools to avoid filament tangles. For more eco-friendly, our PLA comes in cardboard spools, which degrade faster than plastic spools. In addition, there are three holes for monitoring the remaining filament and timely replacement.

  No Clogging or Bubbles: Dry completely before packing, and the packing bag is vacuum sealed with desiccants to protect the filament from moisture and dust, with no clogging and air bubbles.

  Widely Compatible: Universally compatible with most common 1.75mm FDM 3D printers on the market due to its high performance and +/- 0.02mm dimensional accuracy.
