  High-Speed Printing: With enhanced fluidity, our RAPID PLA+ filament melts rapidly and flows smoothly, allowing for a fast printing speed of up to 600mm/s. This feature ensures that you can complete your printing projects quickly without compromising on quality.

  Enhanced Strength & Toughness: ELEGOO RAPID PLA+ filament features high flexural modulus and elongation at break, which makes it resistant to brittleness and cracking. This feature ensures that your prints are less deformed than usual PLA.

  Good Layer Adhesion: Our filament has a better cooling effect and strong layer bonding capabilities that make it perfect for printing overhangs and bridges. This feature ensures a smooth surface on your final prints with fewer visible layer lines.

  0.02mm Dimensional Accuracy: RAPID PLA+ filament boasts a dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.02mm and a strict tolerance of 1.75mm diameter, which ensures smooth and consistent filament outflow and reduces the risk of nozzle clogging.

  Less-tangle & Neatly Wound: All filaments are fully mechanical wound with a secondary sub-winding and strict manual inspection to ensure that the lines are neatly arranged on the reels, reducing tangles and possible snapping.

  No Clogging or Bubbles: Complete dried before packing and vacuum sealed with desiccants in the bag, ensuring that it is free from moisture and dust, and reducing the risk of clogging or bubbles during printing. All filaments adopt an eco-friendly cardboard spool, which is both sturdy and easy to use.
