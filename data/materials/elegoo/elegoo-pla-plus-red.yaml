  Brand New PLA Plus Filament: Made from premium eco-friendly materials, Elegoo PLA Plus minimizes warpage and shrinkage for precise prints. It offers excellent printability, superior strength, and flexibility, ensuring a consistent and odorless printing experience.

  Tough & High Impact Strength: With enhanced toughness and better tensile strength, ELEGOO PLA Plus has even higher impact strength and less brittleness & deformation than usual PLA. Meanwhile, the better cooling effect makes the overhang printing effect better and higher success rate of printing suspended models.  

  Glossy Surface & Good Layer Adhesion: Accurate deposition and strong layer bonding bring a smoother surface finish without layer delamination issues. The lower printing temperature and stable thermoforming dimensions make it very easy to print with excellent print quality.

  Less-tangle & Neatly Wound: Full mechanical winding with secondary sub-winding and strict manual inspection ensures that the lines are neatly arranged on the reels, which effectively reduces the occurrence of crossed turns and tangles and avoids possible snap and line breakage. 

  Dimensional Accuracy & Consistency: Strict tolerances and perfect dimensional accuracy ensure smooth and consistent feeding and optimal flow through the extruder for these 1.75mm PLA Plus filaments with a dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.02mm.

  No Clogging & No Bubbles: Complete dried before packing and vacuum sealed with desiccants in the bag to protect the filament from moisture and dust, no clogs and no bubbles. Perfectly compatible with most 1.75mm FDM 3D printers on the market.
