  Enhanced Rigidity: ELEGOO PLA PRO filament offers superior rigidity and stiffness than PLA. This ensures that your prints are resistant to deformation for long-lasting functionality.

  Dimensional Accuracy & Consistency: Our PLA PRO filament delivers exceptional dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.02 mm. This guarantees your prints will print with outstanding tolerance and consistency.

  Wide Temperature Range: Our filaments have a wider print temperature range, allowing you to experiment with different print speeds. Whether you prefer high or low speed printing, our filaments can meet your needs.

  Less-Tangle & Neatly Wound: Our filament is meticulously wound on an eco-friendly cardboard spool. Each spool undergoes full mechanical winding and rigorous manual inspection to minimize tangles and knots.

  No Clogging and Bubbles: All filaments are completely dried before packing and vacuum sealed with desiccants to prevent moisture and dust. Say goodbye to clogs or bubbles that can ruin your prints.

  Wide Compatibility: ELEGOO PLA PRO filaments are compatible with most FDM 3D printers available on the market. It works seamlessly with various printer setups and configurations.
