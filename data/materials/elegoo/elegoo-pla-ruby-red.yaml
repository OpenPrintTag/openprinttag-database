  Matte Macaron Color: ELEGOO PLA MATTE filament features matte low-saturation macaron colors. These pastel shades bring a touch of elegance to your prints, while the matte finish helps to hide visible layer lines for a better visual appeal.

  Less Stringing and Deformation: Our PLA MATTE is less prone to stringing and deformation than PLA, resulting in cleaner and more accurate prints, reducing the need for post-processing and saving you time and effort.

  Faster Printing Speed: Boost your productivity with our PLA MATTE filament. It supports printing speeds of up to 250mm/s, allowing you to complete your printing projects faster without compromising much print quality.

  Exceptional Dimensional Accuracy: Our matte PLA boasts an impressive dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.02mm and a tight tolerance of 1.75mm diameter, ensuring consistency and precision in every print.

  Less-Tangle & Neatly Wound: Each cardboard spool is neatly wound and undergoes strict manual inspection to prevent filament entangles and crossed turns, providing a smooth and uninterrupted printing experience.

  No Clogging or Bubbles: All filaments go through a complete drying process and are vacuum-sealed with desiccants to prevent dust and moisture. This reduces clogging or bubbles during printing and maintains optimal filament conditions.
