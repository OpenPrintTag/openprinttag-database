  Nylon with 10% carbon fiber combines the flexibility and strength of nylon with the rigidity and lightness of carbon fiber. This blend results in a high-performance filament, ideal for parts requiring durability, dimensional stability, and low weight.

      High mechanical strength: The addition of carbon fiber reinforces the nylon, increasing its tensile and compressive strength, making it ideal for high-demand functional parts.

      Increased rigidity: Compared to standard nylon, this material has significantly higher stiffness, reducing excessive flexibility in long or thin parts.

      Low warping: Carbon fiber helps minimize warping during printing, improving the dimensional accuracy of printed parts.

      Finish: Nylon with carbon fiber usually results in more matte surfaces, less prone to shine, giving a technical and functional appearance.
