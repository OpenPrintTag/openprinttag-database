  PRODUCTION

  All EUMAKERS’ filaments are produced with solar energy in our factories situated in Italy, respecting the highest standards of production.
  QUALITY CONTROL

  We check each component used in the production of our coils in our laboratories. A laser measurement system allows us to have real-time production control to guarantee high-quality products and low tolerance values.
  PACKAGING

  All filaments and spools are vacuum-sealed to prevent damage from environmental exposure. In the box, you will find a zipper bag to storage them after use.
  The boxes we ship the filaments with are made of impact and water-resistant cardboard. This prevents damage during transport.
  SHIPPING

  Worldwide. FREE shipping for the purchase of filaments from €115.
