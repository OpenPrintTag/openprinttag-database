  STYX PA6 is an industrial grade nylon 3D printer filament that 3D prints on relatively low temperatures and combines excellent mechanical, chemical and hygroscopic properties with printability.

  STYX PA6 is an easier to 3D print nylon filament compared to other PA6 filaments. It has much lower warping and improved layer adhesion. This makes STYX PA6 a versatile nylon filament for 3D printing end-use parts. FormFutura's STYX PA6 exhibits good resistance to oils, fuels, and lubricants. It has a high impact strength and good mechanical properties. 3D printed parts are strong, durable, and shows good resistance to wear and abrasion. This makes STYX PA6 a great filament for 3D printing functional engineering parts.

  Important key features

      Low warping PA6 filament
      Easy to print with a very good layer adhesion
      High strength and resistance to abrasion
      High chemical resistance
      Good electrical insulating properties

   
  Suitable applications

      Making electrical insulating parts
      End-use parts that require a high wear resistance
      Parts that are resistant to oils, lubricants, and fuels
      Making jigs and fixtures
