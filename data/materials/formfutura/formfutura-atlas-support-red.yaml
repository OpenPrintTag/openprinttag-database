  Atlas Support is a water-soluble PVA type of 3D printer filament that is ideal as support material for complex multi-extrusion 3D printing with PETG based filaments as build material.

  Atlas Support is a water-soluble PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) support material for complex multi extrusion prints. It is designed to be used in combination with PETG based materials. Atlas Support is a 3D printer filament with a high thermal stability and can be printed at slightly higher temperatures compared to regular PVA.
  Key features

      Excellent (cold) water solubility
      Improved thermal stability, resulting in less risk on deterioration/crystalizing inside the nozzle
      Max thermal stability of 225° C, tested up to 256 seconds with no flow
      Biodegradable once dissolved in water
      Safe dissolution in tap water
      Can be disposed of in the kitchen sink, or household drain with an excess of water
      Good bonding to PETG-based materials and other (thermo)plastics that print within a similar temperature range
      Less sensitive to deterioration by humidity compared to regular PVA

   
  Applications

      Reliable multi-extrusion 3D printing of complex structures that require a water-soluble support material
      3D printing geometries with large overhangs, or complex hollow structures
      PVA Molds
