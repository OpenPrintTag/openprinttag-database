  Polyethylene Terephthalate-Glycol engineering filament with 10% additional glass fiber. Exceptionally easy to 3D print on open desktop machines, no enclosure, or heated chamber needed.

  AthenaX GF10 combines all benefits of our AthenaX filament plus 10% glass fibers. This glass fiber reinforcement has significant advantages. It offers not only great electrical- and thermal insulation properties. Your 3D printed parts will not only be stiff, strong and durable. They will also be resistant to wear and chemicals. In short, AthenaX GF10 is your go-to engineering filament. Even for the most demanding applications.

  This engineering filament is very easy to 3D print on open desktop machines. No enclosure, or heated chamber needed. Its low shrinkage factor and perfect layer adhesion make AthenaX GF10 a breeze to print with. Both on desktop and large format 3D printers.
