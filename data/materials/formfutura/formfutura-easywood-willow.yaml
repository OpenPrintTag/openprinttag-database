  EasyWood is a PLA-based 3D printer filament that is filled with 40% wood particles. EasyWood filament is perfect for 3D printing objects with real wood-like aesthetics, smell and touch.

  EasyWood looks, feels and smells like real wood. A beautiful wood-nerve structures can be obtained by grinding the printed object with a piece of fine grit sandpaper. Alternatively the same result can be obtained by varying the print temperature during the printing process.
  EasyWood is a PLA-based filament which is filled with 40% grinded wood particles. The wood particles in the filament have the added benefit of warp-free printing.

  Unique features

      Extremely high wood-filling of 40%
      Real wood feel, look and smell
      Very easy to print
      Warp-free printing and no deformation after cooling
      Great thermal stability and filament flowing behaviour
      Perfect first- and inter-layer adhesion
      Can be printed at high printing speeds
      By postprocessing the printed object with a piece of fine grit sandpaper
      By varying with the print/extrusion temperature
      Biodegradable
