  PLActive is a PLA type of 3D printer filament enhanced with a patented nano-copper composite that eliminates more than 99.99% of fungi, viruses, bacteria and microorganisms.

  Copper 3D PLActive is an innovative Nanocomposite 3D printer filament developed with a high-quality PLA compound and a patented, scientifically validated and highly effective Nano-Copper additive. PLActive filament is FDA registered and eliminates more than 99.99% of fungi, viruses, bacteria and a wide range of microorganisms.


      FDA registered filament
      Compliant to European Union norms: No. 1935/2004 and No. 2023/2006
      Antibacterial action has been scientifically validated eliminating more than 99.99% of fungi, viruses, bacteria and a wide range of microorganisms
      Scientifically proven effective against SARS-CoV-2 / Covid-19 with a high antiviral efficacy from 30 seconds and a viral burden reduction higher than 99% in one hour
      Clinically tested in prosthesis for amputees with excellent results
      Ideal for the manufacture of other medical applications where it's dangerous to have bacterial contamination, such as postoperative prostheses, wound dressing and surgical equipment
      ISO 10993 certified for skin contact
      Antibacterial properties confirmed by two microbiology laboratories in Chile and USA
      Manufactured in the Netherlands according to ISO 9001/2015 certified manufacturing standards
      PLActive has thermoforming characteristics that facilitate post-processing and final adjustments of the 3D printed application
      Compatible with AquaSolve for complex multi-extrusion 3D printing
      It can be "hospital sterilized" by various methods (UCV, Ozone, EthOx, Bleach), but NOT with Dry or Wet Heat (autoclave) because this will ruin the PLA, not the additive. The additive remains stable until 990ºC
      Biodegradable

  Applications

      Medical applications
      Food contact and processing applications
      Orthopedics
      Surgical guides and equipment
      Water-filtering applications
      Postoperative prostheses
