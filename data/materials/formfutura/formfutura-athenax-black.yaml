description: |
  AthenaX is our engineering grade PCTG with the same X-factor as ApolloX and TitanX. This means plug and play 3D printing. Athena's X-factor ensures low shrinkage plus increased bed- and layer adhesion. This PCTG filament 3D prints as easy as PETG. But, with a superior clarity and impact resistance. Its impact resistance is comparable to Tough PLA. AthenaX enables you to 3D print parts with high dimensional accuracy. Precise parts that are durable, tough, and have a good resistance to chemicals. AthenaX is a water-resistant polymer, which makes it a very versatile material. It is suitable for (food) packaging, electronic housings and even biomedical applications.

   
  Important key features

      High impact strength comparable to Tough PLA.
      High transparency / clarity.

      HDT of 76°C / Vicat of 88°C.
      Water-resistant (hydrophobic) polymer.

   
  Suitable applications

      Packaging and containers.
      Electronic housings and components.
      3D printing end-use parts
      Small-scale production
      Making tooling and manufacturing aids.
