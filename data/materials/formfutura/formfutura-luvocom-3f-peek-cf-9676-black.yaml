  Luvocom 3F PEEK CF 9676 is one of the highest performing PEEK 3D printer filaments with carbon fiber reinforcement, which 3D prints PEEK parts with improved stiffness and compressive strength.

  Luvocom 3F PEEK CF 9676 is a carbon-fiber reinforced PEEK (Polyether Ether Ketone) 3D printer filament. The carbon fibers inside Luvocom 3F PEEK CF 9676 filament significantly improve the stiffness and compressive strength properties of 3D printed parts.

  The material unlocks industrial 3D printing applications in various industries, such as aerospace, medical, oil & gas, energy, marine, and automotive. In these industries, it can be used to produce parts that can replace traditional metal and composite parts.

  Parts that are 3D printed with Luvocom 3F PEEK CF 9676 filament are suitable for use in applications that will be exposed to short term service temperatures of up to 280°C and continious service temperatures up to 250°C.

  Luvocom 3F PEEK CF 9676 filament is suitable for 3D printing dynamically-stressed parts,  chemically- and hydrolytically- resistant parts, non-flammable parts and applications which require inherent flame resistance with low smoke and low toxic gas emissions.
