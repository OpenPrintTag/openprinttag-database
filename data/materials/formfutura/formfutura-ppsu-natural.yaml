description: |
  PPSU is an ultra-performance 3D printer filament that can be used to 3D print parts for demanding applications that are chemical resistant and can operate in temperatures up to 180°C.

  PPSU (Polyphenylsulfone) is an amorphous ultra-performance filament based on sulfone polymer from Solvay. PPSU has a glass transition temperature of 220°C. Parts printed with PPSU filament can operate in temperatures up to 180°C. It is resistant against most common automotive fluids. It also is designed to meet the UL 94 V-0 standards with low smoke evolution and low smoke toxicity, making the filament extremely suitable for automotive applications.
  The material is qualified for unlimited steam sterilization through EtO gas, radiation, steam autoclaving, plasma, dry heat and cold sterilization. These are ideal characteristics for usage in the medical industry. The material also meets the  ISO10993 standards for medical applications.
  PPSU offers a better impact resistance and chemical resistance compared to regular PEI filaments.
