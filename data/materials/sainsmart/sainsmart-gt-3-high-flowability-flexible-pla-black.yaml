      Flexibility: Flexible PLA stretches more than 500-600% at break. It can bend and stretch without breaking, making it ideal for printing objects that require flexibility, such as shoe insoles, cell phone cases, wearable accessories and objects with intricate shapes.
      Lightning Fast: The SainSmart GT-3 High Flowability Flexible PLA filament is designed to balance high printing speeds of up to 500mm/s with printing quality. Its excellent fluidity and viscosity factors reduce stringing and sagging, taking your printing to the next level. For optimal results, we recommend a printing speed of around 300 mm/s.
      No Clogging or Jamming: Superior flow ensures smooth, consistent printing so you can bring your designs to life with ease.
      Compatibility: This filament, with its 1.75mm diameter, will work on a variety of 3D printers like Prusa, Creality, AnkerMake M5, QI DI, ANYCUBIC, Flashforge, Monoprice, SCRIB3D, MYNT3D, etc.
      Well Packaging: Our Flexible PLA filament is vacuum sealed to prevent moisture damage and ensure quality printing.
