  Reduced Weight: Designed with active foaming technology, the SainSmart LW PLA Filament density of 0.54g/cm³ compared to 1.2 g/cm³ for regular PLA, means a huge weight reduction to your printed parts, perfect for stuff like RC planes and drones. The reduced weight enables lower wing loads and stall speed, allowing for overall better performance.

  2X 3D Prints with One Spool: The foaming expansion of this LW PLA filament makes it possible for you to print at up to 2X Material flow so that you can print more with less material. One LW PLA roll equals up to 2.2 ordinary PLA rolls.

  Unlimited Customization: The LW PLA filament will start expanding with certain printing temperatures above 210 ℃. By adjusting the printing temperature, speed, and flow during your print, you can customize the expansion effect by using different temperatures and speeds in a section on a model for varied density.

  Smooth Finish & Paint Friendly: Models printed with this LW PLA filament has a smooth matte surface with minimum layer lines. The improved paint adhesion also sets no limit on your creativity.

  Perfect Materials for RC Planes: The expanding property of this PLA Filament allows for excellent layer bonding, better drop resistance and repairability. In combination with the low-density feature, this filament a perfect option for RC Planes and Drones Parts and cosplay Models.
