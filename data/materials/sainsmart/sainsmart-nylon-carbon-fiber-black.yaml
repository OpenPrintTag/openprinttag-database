description: |-
  The Nylon Filament Blended with Carbon Fiber is an incredibly strong and durable material, which is very suitable for printing functional parts such as gears or engineer design prototypes.

      We use new formula to improve its rigidity and print performance: 75% nylon coupled with 25% carbon fiber.
      It features with lower shrink rate, higher strength and rigidity, less warpage and more resistant to wear and tear comparing to the traditional nylon filament.
      It is suitable for those looking to make both strong and flexible industrial parts, prosthetics, medical equipment and complex costumes etc.
      Due to its unique attribute of abrasiveness, we recommend to use a 0.6mm or larger stainless steel nozzle instead of regular soft metal nozzles.
