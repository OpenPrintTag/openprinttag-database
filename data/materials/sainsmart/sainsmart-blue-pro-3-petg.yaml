  Are you tired of tangles spools ruining hours of printing? Are you looking for an all-around filament to get you started with your first 3D prints? We are excited to tell you that SainSmart PRO-3 series PETG filament can resolve all your concerns.

  No Jamming at All

  Supported by an all-new technology called layer by layer, PRO-3 is featured with 100% tangle-free. This ensures the filament printed extremely smooth and no more extruder become clogged again.

  Laser Precision

  Inspected by laser, PRO-3 ensures each inch of filament is precisely engineered to +/-0.02mm error rate. Consistent round shape avoids unexpected interruption in printing.

  Smart Indicator

  A smart length indicator is present on the surface of the clear PC spool for your convenience to know the length of your remaining filament.

  Durable and Strong

  Featuring with high impact-resistant and less warpage, PRO-3 PETG filament has minimal shrinkage and warping.

  Reputation

  PRO-3 PETG filament has the reputation of combining the functionality of ABS (stronger, temperature resistant, more durable) and reliability of PLA (easy to print) in one material.
