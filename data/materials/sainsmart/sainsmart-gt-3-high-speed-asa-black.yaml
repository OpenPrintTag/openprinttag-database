      UV & Weather Resistance: ASA filament can withstand UV ray exposure and harsh weather conditions without significant deterioration, making it an ideal option for outdoor applications such as signs, marine accessories, etc.
      Temperature Resistance: The SainSmart ASA has the ability to withstand temperatures up to 100-105°C without deforming. It also displays high toughness and impact resistance. Compared to ABS, ASA produces fewer noticeable fumes.
      Adhesive for 3D Printing: Applying an adhesive helps the first layer of the print adhere firmly to the bed, reducing the chances of warping and ensuring a more stable foundation for the rest of the print.
      Lightning Fast: The GT-3 Hyper Speed ASA filament combines rapid print speeds of up to 500 mm/s with exceptional print quality. Experience consistently amazing results by giving your high-speed printer a turbo boost! We recommend a printing speed of around 300 mm/s for optimal results.
      Compatibility: This filament, with its 1.75mm diameter, will work on a variety of 3D printers like Bamboo, Prusa, Creality, AnkerMake M5, QI DI, ANYCUBIC, Flashforge, Monoprice, SCRIB3D, MYNT3D, etc.
