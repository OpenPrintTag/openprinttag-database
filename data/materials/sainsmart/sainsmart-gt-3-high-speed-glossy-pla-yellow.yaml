  Lightning Fast: The GT-3 Hyper Speed filament is designed for high-speed 3D printers to achieve an impressive fusion of rapid print speeds up to 500 mm/s and unparalleled print quality. Imagine giving your high-speed printer a turbo boost for consistently amazing results!

  Smooth & Glossiness: PLA prints have smooth surfaces, especially when printed with fine layer heights. They have a slight sheen and a consistent surface texture, resulting in an attractive appearance.

  Easy-to-Remove Support: Detaching supports is a quick and easy process when using this filament. They can be taken off without damaging the model underneath, keeping all of its fine details intact.

  No Clogging or Jamming: This PLA+ filament has a softening temperature of 140°C, making it resistant to the cooling effects from the nozzle. This solves the obstruction issue.

  Compatibility: This filament, with its 1.75mm diameter, will work on a variety of 3D printers like Bamboo, Prusa, Creality, AnkerMake M5, QI DI, ANYCUBIC, Flashforge, Monoprice, SCRIB3D, MYNT3D, etc. For optimal results, we recommend a printing speed of around 30- 300 mm/s.

  For using the glass printing platform, it is recommended to apply more glue when printing, or use masking paper, and increase the temperature of the hotbed to about 65°C.
