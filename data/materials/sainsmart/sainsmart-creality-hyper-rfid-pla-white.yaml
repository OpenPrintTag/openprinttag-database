  Creality CFS will automatically sync with Creality Hyper PLA's built-in RFID chip, reading its type, color, and more to optimize printer settings instantly. No more manual adjustments—experience hassle-free setup, precise printing, and reduced filament waste.

  Exclusive Multi-Colour Printing: Creality Hyper PLA with RFID is compatible with multi-color 3D printers from various brands. When paired with the Creality K2 Plus Combo and CFS, it unleashes the full potential of automatic filament recognition, delivering seamless full-color printing without hassle.

  High-Speed Printing: Achieve rapid results with Creality Hyper PLA, capable of printing up to 600 mm/s without losing quality. This filament supports both fast and standard speeds, perfect for users eager to complete 3D projects efficiently and effectively.

  Higher Toughness: Superior tensile strength compared to ABS and higher toughness than traditional PLA. Enhances structural integrity and durability of printed models.

  Exceptional Dimensional Accuracy: Precision of +/-0.03 mm ensures smooth filament flow and uniform outputs. Delivers excellent bridging and layer fusion for detailed, high-quality prints. With its 1.75mm diameter, will work on a variety of 3D printers like Prusa, Creality, AnkerMake M5, QI DI, ANYCUBIC, Flashforge, Monoprice, SCRIB3D, MYNT3D, etc.
