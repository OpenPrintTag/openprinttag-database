  Incredible strength and durability: SainSmart Carbon Fiber PETG Filament is super strong, and perfect for printing items that require added strength. It’s more abrasive than standard PETG, providing higher rigidity and strength. With its toughness, wear resistance, and tear resistance, this filament is built to last.

  Wide industrial applications: This filament is perfect for a variety of industrial applications, from aerospace to engineering to motorsports. Its versatility makes it a go-to choice for professionals in a wide range of fields.

  Better dimensional stability: Say goodbye to warping and hello to smooth, warp-free prints. SainSmart Carbon Fiber PETG Filament offers excellent layer adhesion and easy support removal, ensuring that your prints come out looking their best every time.

  Excellent mechanical properties: Filled with 10% Carbon Fiber combined with 90% PETG, this filament is designed to provide high-quality prints with ease. Its excellent material proportioning ensures that your prints are not only strong and durable, but also easy to print.

  [Tip]: Carbon Fiber PETG filament can be a bit trickier to print with than PLA or normal PETG, but don’t worry! Here are some tips to help you succeed: Use a larger, abrasion-resistant steel nozzle (0.6mm or more) and keep it clean to prevent clogging. Dry the filament before printing and use an enclosure to maintain a constant ambient temperature for best results. Print at 220°C-260°C with a bed temperature of 70°C-100°C, fan speed at 0%, and print speed of 40-60mm/s
