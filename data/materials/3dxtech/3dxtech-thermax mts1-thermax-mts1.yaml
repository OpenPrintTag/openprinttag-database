description: |-
  MTS1 Break Away Support was developed for our Gearbox HT2 3D Printer. This material is specifically formulated as a break away support for PC model materials. Suitable for open-source printers with non-heated chambers and those with chambers up to 140C.

  Benefits of THERMAX MTS1

      Excellent break away support for PC/ABS, PC, and PA materials
      Pre-programmed into the Gearbox HT2 for ease of printing 


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
