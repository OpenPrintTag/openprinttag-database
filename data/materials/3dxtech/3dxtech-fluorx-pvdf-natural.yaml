description: |-
  PVDF [Polyvinylidene fluoride] is a high-performance polymer which offers exceptional thermal and chemical resistances. Rated for uses up to 130C - this filament can be used in demanding applications under the most extreme conditions. PVDF is resistant to most chemicals and solvents, making it a great fit for applications which will be exposed to harsh environments.

  Benefits of FluorX PVDF

      High Thermal Properties: 130C CUT
      Excellent resistance to a broad range of chemicals, such as automotive fluids, oils, gas, lubricants, fully halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids, and bases
      Non-hygroscopic, does not absorb moisture. No drying needed!
      Inherently UV-resistant with very stable H-F bonds.
      Low smoke and flame characteristics with a base resin rated V-0
      Long-term hydrolytic stability
      Resistant to nuclear radiation
      Very good abrasion resistance - similar to Nylon and UHMW-PE for high-wear applications 


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
