description: |-
  ThermaX PPE-PS is a polyphenylene ether alloy which exhibits exceptional thermal, mechanical, and chemical resistance properties. Our PPE-PS filament is made from a UL94 V0 rated flame retardant base resin. ThermaX PPE has been an ideal material for a wide array of applications in demanding markets such as aerospace, automotive, industrial, electronics, and telecommunications.


  Benefits of ThermaX PPE+PS

      High thermal properties with an HDT of 120C
      Flame retardant rated UL94 V-0
      UV resistance making it suitable for outdoor applications, rated F1 per UL 746C
      Amorphous structure granting it very low, near isotropic shrinkage
      Excellent chemical resistance to most aqueous solutions, detergents, acids, and bases
      Excellent long-term hydrolytic stability making it very stable in boiling water
      Stable dielectric constant and dissipation factor over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies 


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
