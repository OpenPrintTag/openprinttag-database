description: |-
  WearX PA6 has been modified for enhanced wear resistance for greatly improved wear resistance vs. standard PA6. WearX PA6 offers a harder surface, improved dimensional stability, and a matte surface appearance. This material was inspired by the need for an enhanced material specifically formulated to resist sliding and rotational wear.

  End Use Tip: Ideal for 3D printing net shape or near-net shape tribological applications that were previously machined from stock shapes such as Nylatron GS MoS2 filled nylons.

  Pro Tip: Wear resistance gradually diminishes as in-use temperatures rise and are limited in this formulation to 120C. WearX PA6 was formulated for enhanced wear resistance under dry conditions, but the addition of external lubricants will extend wear-life, especially at elevated temperatures and under increased loading and/or speeds (high PV's).


  Benefits of WearX Wear Resistant Nylon Filament

      3x Improved Wear Resistance vs. Unfilled AmideX PA6 Copolymer
      High strength 62 MPa tensile str. with lightly lower impact / elongation vs. unfilled nylon
      Improved chemical resistance compared to many other traditional 3D printing filaments
      Excellent printability with a more matte surface than unfilled PA6-66 copolymers
      Good thermal properties with a Tg of 76C, 143C HDT, and Tm of 200C 



  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
