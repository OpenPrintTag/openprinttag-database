description: |-
  Obsidian-GF Glass Fiber Reinforced PA6 filament was formulated to offer rich colorful options in an engineering-grade material for your Markforged printer. Obsidian-GF is a lower-cost Markforged Onyx Alternative suitable for all Markforged printers. We developed this material after extensive analysis and testing on our own in-house Markforged printer and many outside beta testers. The result is a seamless printing experience that produces parts with an outstanding appearance and excellent mechanical properties. Made using premium chopped glass fiber and PA6 copolymer, Obsidian-GF is an excellent alternative to OnyxTM that allows our customers choose brilliant colors, excellent mechanical properties, and save money when using your Markforged printer.

  Don't have a Markforged printer? That's no problem - ObsidianTM-GF is also compatible with all non-Markforged printers that are suitable for printing PA6+GF. Take advantage of the excellent strength, stiffness, and appearance of this specialty material without over spending on Markforged OnyxTM.


  Benefits of OBSIDIAN GF+PA6

      9 Brilliant Colors
      9 More ductile (less brittle) than CF reinforced PA6
      30% savings vs. Markforged OnyxTM
      Excellent strength and stiffness
      Resistant to aliphatic hydrocarbons (oil/gas/lubricants)
      Superior dimensional stability (low warp/shrink/CTE)
      Compatible with Markforged FX20, X7, X5, X3, Mark Two, Onyx Pro, and Onyx One printers 



  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
