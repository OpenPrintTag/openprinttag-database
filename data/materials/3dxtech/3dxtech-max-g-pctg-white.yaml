description: |-
  MAX-G PCTG is an excellent alternative to the ever-popular PETG. Both PCTG and PETG are polyesters and great printing materials, but PCTG offers improved clarity, chemical resistance and impact resistance vs. PETG - making it a more durable engineering-grade option for demanding applications. This material exhibits low shrinkage and excellent dimensional stability making it a go-to for engineering applications. PCTG does not require a heated chamber and is easily printed on most open-source desktop printers.


  Benefits of MAX-GTM PCTG

      Superior chemical resistance to ABS and PETG
      Very low odor while printing
      Amorphous structure giving it a low, near isotropic shrinkage
      Low moisture absorption, 3x lower than ABS
      Wide range of processing from 250-270C
      Superior ductility vs. PETG 



  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
