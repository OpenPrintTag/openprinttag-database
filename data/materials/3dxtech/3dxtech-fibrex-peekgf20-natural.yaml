description: |-
  FibreX PEEK+GF20 (PolyEtherEtherKetone) is one of the highest-performance polymers in world. In fact, it's one of the highest-performance plastics ever invented. Now reinforced 20% with glass fibers, PEEK+GF20 has exceptional mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance properties along with its low warp, increased stiffness, and improved dimensional stability. PEEK+G20 is a go-to material in some of the most demanding applications where failure is not an option.


  Benefits of FibreX PEEK+GF20

      Inherently flame resistant and self-extinguishing
      Long-term hydrolytic stability even above 250C
      Outstanding resistance to a broad range of chemicals, including automotive fluids, fully halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, and aqueous solutions
      Low smoke and toxic gas emissions
      Excellent dimensional stability with low heat creep, low and uniform coefficient of thermal expansion, giving PEEK highly reproducible part-to-part dimensions
      High thermal properties with a Tg of 143C, CUT of 260C, and Tm of 343 





  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
