  3DXSTATTM ESD PA12 is made using a specialty Nylon 12 (PA12) and CNT matrix that we chose for it's printability, thermal properties, and chemical resistance. ESD PA12 is widely used in a variety of industries due to its excellent chemical resistance, low moisture absorption, and wide processing window. Our formulation ensures very low shrinkage in the printed part resulting in excellent dimensional stability, making our ESD PA12 an excellent choice for tools, fixtures, and jigs.


  Benefits of 3DXSTAT ESD-Nylon 12

      3DXSTAT ESD PA12 is made using a specialty Nylon 12 (PA12) and CNT matrix that we chose for it's printability, thermal properties, and chemical resistance. ESD PA12 is widely used in a variety of industries due to its excellent chemical resistance
      High thermal properties, with an HDT of 150C
      Very low moisture absorption yielding improved retention of mechanical properties even when exposed to humid environments
      Low density makes it ideal for light-weight parts
      Superior chemical resistances, especially when compared to PA6 and PA6/66 nylons
      Excellent dimensional stability and reproducible part-to-part measurements 


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
