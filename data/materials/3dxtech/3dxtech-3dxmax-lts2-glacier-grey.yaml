description: |-
  LTS2 Break Away Support was developed for our GearboxTM HT2 3D Printer. This material is specifically formulated as a break away support for ABS and ASA model materials. LTS2 is capable of supporting ABS and ASA in heated build chambers up to 100degreesC. Suitable for open-source printers with non-heated chambers and those with chambers up to 100degreesC.


  Benefits of 3DXMAX LTS2

      Good adhesion to ABS and ASA 


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
