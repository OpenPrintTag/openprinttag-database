description: |-
  3DXTECH produces this 3D printing filament using a specialty compound custom-formulated using ULTEM 1010 PEI resin and advanced carbon additives. PEI is an amorphous, high-performance polymer that combines excellent mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance properties.

  Our PEI based filaments offer the ability to create parts with excellent properties at elevated temperatures due to a very high glass transition temperature (Tg). Ideal for use in critical applications which require electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, a high level of cleanliness, and the outstanding thermal and chemical properties you've come to expect with PEI based compounds.

  Benefits of ThermaX PEI 1010

      High thermal properties, with a Tg of 217C
      Inherently flame-resistant
      Long-term hydrolytic stability
      Excellent dimensional stability, low heat creep sensitivity, and a very low, uniform coefficient of thermal expansion create highly reproducible part-to-part dimensions
      Exceptional strength and modulus, even at elevated temperatures
      Good resistance to a broad range of chemicals, include automotive fluids, fully halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, and aqueous solutions
      Stable dielectric constant and dissipation factor over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies 


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
