description: |-
  Manufactured in the USA from 100% virgin High Impact Polystyrene resin. We use state-of-the-art resins manufacturing technologies to give you the best possible printing experience. HIPS can be used for parts that require low-gloss and nearly invisible layer lines. It does not absorb moisture, so you do not need to keep it in a dry box. Plus, it requires very little setup to achieve truly great prints in practically any 3D printer. It can also be used as an excellent break-away support for ABS and ASA or completely dissolved in d-limonene. Precision extruded using our own formulation, this grade is a bit different than the usual HIPS used to make our model material colors. It's formulated to be more sensitive to attack from d-limonene solvent and make a better dissolving support solution.


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
