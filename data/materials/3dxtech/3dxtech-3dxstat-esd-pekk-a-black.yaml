description: |-
  Made using Arkema Kepstan PEKK (PolyEtherKetoneKetone) and state of the art conductive additives, this ESD PEKK-A is one of the highest-performance polymers in world and ideal for demanding applications. This filament was created for the highest-spec situations where tightly controlled static dissipation, thermal properties, and mechanical performance properties are required. Target surface resistance of 10^4 to 10^9 Ohm.


  Benefits of 3DXSTAT ESD-PEKK-A

      Substantially easier to print than PEEK, made using 50/40 type PEKK copolymer known as PEKK-A
      High thermal properties with a Tg of 162C, HDT of 150C, and Tm of 305C
      Inherently flame resistant and self-extinguishing
      Long-term hydrolytic stability making it ideal for steam and autoclave environments
      Excellent dimensional stability with low heat creep, low and uniform coefficient of thermal expansion, and highly reproducible part-to-part dimensions
      Exceptional strength and modulus, even at high temperatures
      Excellent resistance to a broad range of chemicals, such as automotive fluids, fully halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, and aqueous solutions
      Stable dielectric constant and dissipation factor over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies 


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
