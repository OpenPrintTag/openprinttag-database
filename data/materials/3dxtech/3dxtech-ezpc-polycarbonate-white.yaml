description: |-
  We absolutely love printing ezPC! This polymer was developed specifically for 3D printing functional prototypes and end-use parts. It was formulated to allow for ease of printing coupled with exceptional mechanical and thermal properties.

  ezPC Polycarbonate is an excellent choice for printing parts that would ordinarily fail when using standard materials such as PLA, PETG, or ABS. We consider this an excellent bridge in performance between these lower performance materials and higher priced materials such as Ultem or PEEK.


  Benefits of ezPC Polycarbonate

      Low warp, high heat resistance, and excellent mechanical properties
      Ease of use on a wide array of printers, no heated chamber needed!
      High thermal properties with a Tg of 118C and HDT of 112C
      Superior thermal properties vs. PLA, PETG, ABS, and ASA
      No odors or hazardous fumes while printing making it ideal for a home or office environment
      Perfect for functional end-use parts as well as prototypes
      Excellent adhesion to our AquaTekTM X1 USM Water Soluble Support 



  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
