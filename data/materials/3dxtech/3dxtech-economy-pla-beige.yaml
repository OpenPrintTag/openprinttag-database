  3DXTECH Economy PLA is part of our newest line of high-quality filaments. Our PLA is known for it high quality performance and experienced users understand that performance filaments make the difference. The Economy PLA offers the same high quality performance, but for a fraction of the price.

  PLA is most well-known for its ease of printing, stiffness, and extremely high visual print quality. It is ideal for prototypes, concept models, and end-use printed parts for hobbyists to industry engineers alike!


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
