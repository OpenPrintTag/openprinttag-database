description: |-
  AmideX Nylon 12 was developed for easy printing while offering impressive mechanical properties that make it a superior solution to complex problems. This unique formulation boasts excellent chemical resistance to a wide variety of substances, allowing it to be used on projects where other filaments such as PLA and ABS would not survive. It also retains more dimensional stability during printing and absorbs less moisture than Nylon 6, making it the ideal material when the strength and resilience of Nylon is needed, without the difficulty of 3D printing so stereotypical of this polymer.

  For applications where glass fiber or carbon fiber reinforcements are not needed, but the impressive properties of Nylons are, look no further than AmideX Nylon 12.



  Benefits of AMIDEXTM Nylon 12

      Excellent printability and dimensional stability without fillers
      Great resistance to a variety of chemicals, including Ethers, Esters, and most Bases
      Improved impact strength compared to other Nylons 



  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
