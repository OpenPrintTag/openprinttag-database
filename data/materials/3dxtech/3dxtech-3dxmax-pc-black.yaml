description: |-
  3DXMAX PC (Polycarbonate) is a premium high-heat 3D printing filament made using Lexan Polycarbonate from Sabic. PC has some of the best mechanical properties & high-heat resistance in the 3D Printing world (Tg of 147C). Our PC allows for the printing of functional prototypes and production parts with very fine detail and excellent surface quality. 3DXMAX PC is suitable for use in both consumer-grade and industrial FDM/FFF printers that have a heated print bed and extruders which can reach upwards of 300C. Made by 3DXTECH in the USA.


  Benefits of 3DXMAX PC

      High thermal properties, with a Tg of 147C
      Amorphous structure gives it low, near isotropic shrinkage
      Excellent ductility and impact resistance
      Very low odor while printing
      Wide processing range of 280-310C 



  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
