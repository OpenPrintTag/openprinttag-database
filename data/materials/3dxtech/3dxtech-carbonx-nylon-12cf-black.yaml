description: |-
  CarbonXTM Carbon Fiber PA12 is made using high-modulus carbon fiber and a specialty Nylon 12 (PA12) that we chose for it's printability, thermal properties, and chemical resistance. PA12+CF is widely used in a variety of industries due to its excellent chemical resistance, low moisture absorption, and wide processing window. Our formulation ensures very low shrinkage in the printed part resulting in excellent dimensional stability, making our PA12+CF an excellent choice for tools, fixtures, and jigs.


  Benefits of CarbonX Nylon 12+CF

      High thermal properties, with a CUT of 120C and HDT of 150C
      Excellent strength and stiffness over a wide temperature range, up to 150C
      Very low moisture absorption yielding improved retention of mechanical properties even when exposed to humid environments
      Low density makes it ideal for light-weight parts
      Superior chemical resistances, especially when compared to PA6 nylons
      Low shrinkage and warping for high dimensional stability and reproducible part-to-part measurements 



  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
