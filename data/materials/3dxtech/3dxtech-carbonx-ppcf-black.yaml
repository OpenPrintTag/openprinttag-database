description: |-
  CarbonX PP+CF is made using a specialty formulated polypropylene copolymer reinforced with high-modulus chopped carbon fiber. This filament is based on a patent-pending formulation that offers improved thermal properties and low shrinkage/warp compared to competitive PP-based compounds.

  The reels contain 750g of filament, but based on the very low density of PP+CF, this is the same amount of filament that would typically be found on a 1kg reel of ABS. This allows you to print light-weight and exceptionally rigid parts for medical, drones, watercraft, automotive, or any application which would benefit from a light weight, stiff, chemically resistant material.

  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
