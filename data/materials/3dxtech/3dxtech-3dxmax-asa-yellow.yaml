description: |-
  3DXMAX(R) ASA (Acrylonitirle Styrene Acrylate) is a UV-resistant, famously weatherable polymer. Our ASA has a low-gloss matte finish which makes it the perfect filament for technical-looking prints, especially when you don't want the high-gloss surface finish often associated with 3D printing materials like ABS, PETG, or PLA.

       Excellent mechanical and thermal properties (Tg of 105C)
      Highly resistant to ultra-violet radiation and sunlight
      Sturdy and rugged against the weather, ideal for an outdoor part
      Easier to print than most industrial-grade materials
      Variety of colors and beautiful, low-gloss finish to make your models pop! 


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
