  Our Nylon+GF30 glass fiber reinforced Nylon 6 Copolymer (PA6) is nothing less than an industrial-grade beast! Formulated to be exceptionally stiff and strong, all without being brittle. Polyamides (PA) are the work horse of the plastics industry the world over thanks to their excellent mechanical, chemical, and thermal resistance. The addition of heavy glass fiber reinforcement takes it to the next level.


  Benefits of FIBREXTM Nylon PA6+GF30

      Printable on practically any 3D printer with a heated bed
      Ideal for structural engineering-grade applications
      Exceptionally stiff and strong, without being brittle
      Excellent chemical resistance makes it suitable for automotive and industrial applications
      Resists fuels, lubricants, heat, and mechanical loading
      High thermal properties keep it strong up to 170C in use, depending on printing and mechanical loads applied
      Glass fiber reinforcement improves dimensional stability, reduces shrinkage, lift, and warp 



  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
