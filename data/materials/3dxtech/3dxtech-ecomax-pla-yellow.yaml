description: |-
  PLA is a biopolymer derived from plants. Our premium blend of ECOMAX(R) PLA is made right here in the USA from 100% virgin PLA Natureworks biopolymer resin and premium colorants. It's famous for being perfectly suited to practically all desktop 3D printers, including the Makerbot, Prusa, Ender, Flashforge, Anet, Creality, Lulzbot, Makergear, Ultimaker, and may more printer families.

  PLA is most well-known for its ease of printing, stiffness, and extremely high visual print quality. It is ideal for prototypes, concept models, and end-use printed parts for hobbyists to industry engineers alike!


  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
