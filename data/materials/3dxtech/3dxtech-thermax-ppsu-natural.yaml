description: |-
  Polyphenylsulfone (PPSF or PPSU) is a high-temperature aromatic sulfone polymer. Long considered to be one of the highest performance polymers in the plastics world. PPSU has excellent thermal and chemical resistance, making it well suited for demanding applications in automotive, aerospace, electronics, defense, industrial, medical, semi-con applications. Previously only available to Stratasys customers - now you can print with this ultra performance polymer.


  Benefits of ThermaX PPSU

      Very high thermal properties superior to Ultem 1010
      Inherently flame retardant with low smoke evolution and low smoke toxicity
      High Environmental Stress Crack Resistance (ESCR)
      Sterilization capable, including EtO gas, radiation, steam autoclaving, plasma, dry heat and cold sterilization
      Exceptional strength and modulus, even at elevated temperatures
      Resists most common automotive fluids including gasoline, antifreeze, transmission fluids, motor oils, power steering fluid, windshield washer fluid (ESCR, 24 hrs, 100C)
      Highly resistant to even large (10 Mrd) doses of gamma radiation
      Excellent dimensional stability with low creep sensitivity, low and uniform coefficient of thermal expansion, and highly reproducible part-to-part dimensions. 




  PES has higher temperature resistance and toughness than Ultem 1010, offering the ability to print parts with higher mechanical properties at elevated temperature.

  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
