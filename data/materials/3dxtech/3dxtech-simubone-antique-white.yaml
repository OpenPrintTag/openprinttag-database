  SimuBone Bone Modeling Filament allows you to print realistic bone models for clinical and educational use. Our formulation is based on easy to print PLA coupled with specialty additives that gives your part the look and feel of real bone. Our filament is easy to print on practically any 3D printer and mates perfectly our AquaTek X1 water soluble support for printing complex parts with dual extruder printers.

  ISO Certified Anti-bacterial: We understand that these parts are likely to be handled by many people, so we formulated the polymer to be ISO certified anti-bacterial. Our ISO certified formulation uses a FDA-approved nano-silver antibacterial additive to achieve ISO 22196:2011 certification for eliminating 99.9% of bacteria for the lifetime of the printed part. Furthermore, our SimuBone resin is produced in an ISO 13485 compliant facility and is ideal for use in healthcare clinical and education settings.

  We manufacture all of our filaments in our 68,000 ft2 manufacturing facility (located in Grand Rapids, Michigan) using state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our goal continues to be to make the most innovative filaments on the market - targeting difficult end-use applications.
