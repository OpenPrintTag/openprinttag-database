  It seemed untouchable, always turning pink, but we finally have a formulation good enough to share!  Think hot rods and ruby slippers, this red is going to knock your socks off!!!!  Words can't describe... 

  CANDY APPLE RED METALLIC PLA!!! Need I say more?!?!
  Created from our highest quality, translucent HTPLA v2, this stuff is red and sparkly!

  Candy Apple Red Metallic PLA prints with the ease of standard PLA with standard hardware and temperatures, but make fun, mesmerizing prints that stand out. Celebrate good times by 3d printing metallic red PLA ornaments, toys, and treasures. If you want to make a print more fun, just add glitter. Glitter Flake Red PLA has little risk of clogging or wearing your nozzle, and it won't make a glittery mess, but beware, printing with metallic glitter PLA is sure to be addictive! Glitter particles are relatively small but have some orientation effects, giving top/bottom surfaces more shine than sidewall, so have some fun playing with orientation to see how the result changes!
