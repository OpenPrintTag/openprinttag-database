description: 'Introducing a special, seasonal release: Winter Blue Glitter Flake.  Born out of Project Winterfill, the idea was to capture the spirit of the approaching season in filament form.  Created from our highest quality, translucent HTPLA v2, we carefully introduce just the right amount of blue pigment and sparkle for a cool, wintry blue.  A very dynamic and deep color, the blue concentration creates a light blue color that can extend both towards a silvery green and a deep dark purple depending on form and light.  The additional glitter bits sometimes disappear and in other light bring a frosty finish which make the blue look almost snow-covered.  Having been developed in October, we had fun printing some wrinkly pumpkins to experience to experience the rich beauty of this dynamic color.  Please enjoy creating festive holiday prints and spread good cheer with Proto-pasta''s Winter Blue!'
