      [Excellent UV & Weather Resistance]- iSANMATE ASA filament is a highly durable material that offers exceptional UV, weather, mechanical, and thermal resistance, ensuring stability and durability in different temperature environments.

      [Wide Compatibility and Outdoor Use for Long]- iSANMATE ASA filaments compatible with most consumer and industrial 3D printers. providing effective protection against breakage and color degradation when used outdoors for long-term purposes

      [Recommended Printing Conditions]- The Printing Temp is 240degreesC - 270degreesC (depending on the printer model)which is wider than typical PLA, Printing speed: 30-100mm/s. Hot bed temperature: 80degreesC - 100degreesC; Printing Tips: 1. When you use ASA filament to print models, it is better to print in a closed environment. 2. It is recommended to apply glue to the bed before printing.

      [Vacuum-sealed packaging]-iSANMATE 3D priting filament is carefully vacuum packed with desiccant to maintain the performance of PLA filament and prevent dust and foreign matter from entering.

      [Technical Solutions]- Provide fast and efficient technical solutions when you have any printing problems with 24 hours guaranteed reply;
