  What is PS Imports? It is a collection of filaments made by other manufacturers overseas and sold under the Printed Solid brand. While Printed Solid does make their own line of filaments called Jessie using USA materials and manufactured in the state of Delaware, there is some features that we do not have the machinery to make in house.

  In the 3D printing industry it is very common for resellers to sell filaments made by other companies and market them as their own. At Printed Solid we want to make sure our customers know the whole story. So instead of putting these filaments under our Jessie brand we have created a new product line called PS Imports. That way our customers know exactly where their filaments are coming from.
