  Large 5kg Spool

  Gizmo Dorks is proud to introduce bigger spools in a 5kg net weight filament size for large format 3D printers. Even users who are tired of changing spools will be able to use these 5kg spools on any open 3D printer. The larger spools still carry our top notch Gizmo Dorks filament but will require less filament changing with the printer. The larger amount of filament allows continuous prints without the need to swap out spools. It's perfect for larger builds.
  Filament Types

  Currently, the large format spool is available in ABS, PLA, or HIPS.

  ABS, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, is among the most popular 3D filament materials to print with. It is light weight and durable, which is why LEGOs are made out of ABS. Our ABS filament is made from the highest quality pure ABS resins. We never dilute our ABS filaments with cheap fillers. 

  PLA, Polylactic Acid, is created from processing different plant products which means PLA can be composted, unlike ABS which is derived from fossil fuels. PLA is a fan favorite among 3D printing enthusiasts because it has some favorable printing characteristics such as much less warping compared to ABS.

  HIPS, High Impact Polystyrene, is a good alternative to ABS. It shares very similar characteristics with ABS, commonly using the same printing profile. One particular difference is that limonene is a solvent for HIPS, whereas acetone is a solvent for ABS. HIPS is a versatile and economical 3D printer plastic while still providing excellent strength and impact resistance.
