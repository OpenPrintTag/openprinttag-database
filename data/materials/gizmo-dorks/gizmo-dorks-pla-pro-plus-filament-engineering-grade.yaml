  Gizmo Dorks PLA Pro Plus filament is an engineering grade filament. PLA Pro Plus is not your typical pro grade filament offered by other brands. Gizmo Dorks PLA Pro Plus has increased strength and impact resistance over regular PLA. The filament features superior layer bonding never before achieved. Regular PLA is typically very brittle, which is simply a characteristic of the thermoplastic. PLA Pro Plus has outstanding flexibility to combat the brittleness even after long term storage. Toughness is a mechanical property defined as a material's resistance to fracture, and PLA Pro Plus has 10 times the toughness versus basic PLA. It also has increased stiffness and rigidity and is designed to reduce jamming in the hot end. All of these attributes combine with the normal benefits of PLA such as being virtually warp free to create the perfect 3D printer filament.

  PLA Pro Plus works with a wide range of common 3D printers. The filament is considered a more earth friendly plastic as it can be composted at commercial facilities unlike ABS which is derived from fossil fuels. PLA Pro Plus enjoys sharp details and corners without the risk of cracking or warping. The engineering grade filament can be printed at typical higher throughput speeds just like normal PLA. PLA Pro Plus still maintains an excellent low melting temperature while being odor free unlike ABS. A heated bed is not required but depending on the part and bed surface type it is recommended. The 200 gram spool is a perfect sample size to test out and try the filament before committing to a 1 kg version.

      Hot End Temperature: 195 - 225 C
      Heated Bed: Not required

   After many requests for a smaller sample spool, Gizmo Dorks has proudly released this filament with a net weight of 200 grams per spool. The smaller weight spool allows users to try the filament quality and color before committing to a larger 1 kilogram spool.
