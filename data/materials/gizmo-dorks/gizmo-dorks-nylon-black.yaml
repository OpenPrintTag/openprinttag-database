description: |-
  Nylon prints will stick to blue painter's tape. Because Nylon adheres to cellulose surfaces poplar wood can be used as a bed. Nylon will also adhere to cardboard. Nylon also sticks extremely well to machinable garolite, but that may be hard to come by. Users have also said that using a glue stick on a glass bed works well. PVA glues (think of Elmer's white glue all) can also be diluted and applied on with a sponge head. Please use in a well ventilated area or in a closed ventilated system.

      Extrusion Temperature: 230 - 260 C
      Heated Bed: 110 - 145 C helps combat Nylon's warp
      Diameter: 1.75mm or 2.85mm +/- 0.03mm
      Net Weight: 200 grams
      Available Colors in 200g Size: Black, Natural, White

  Nylon is very hygroscopic. When not in use, please store in an air tight container. Gizmo Dorks has proudly released this filament with a net weight 200 grams. The smaller weight spool allows users to try the filament quality and color before committing to a larger 1 kilogram spool.
