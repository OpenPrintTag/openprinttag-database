description: |-
  Gizmo Dorks ABS filament is made of top notch pure ABS resin. Our ABS resins are of the highest quality and produced with the utmost purity. ABS, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, is a favorite filament among 3D printer users because it is light weight and durable. It can be injection molded which makes it perfect for 3D printing extruders. It has a high glass transition temperature to reduce deformation, but it is also low enough to be safely attainable with standard 3D printers. ABS is a hard strong plastic with some flexibility when compared to PLA. It is also soluble in Acetone, and it can be easily sanded and machined.

  ABS is one of the most widely used plastics in 3D printing and for good reason. It is a strong plastic that has a decent amount of flex. The filament extrudes easily and smoothly with very little stringing or oozing. ABS does cool and shrink after extrusion, so it must be printed on a heated bed and preferably within an enclosed-case. 

      Extrusion Temperature: 225 - 250 C
      Heated Bed: 80 - 110 C
      Diameter: 1.75mm or 2.85mm +/- 0.03mm
      Net Weight: 200 grams

  Gizmo Dorks has proudly released this filament with a net weight 200 grams. The smaller weight spool allows users to try the filament quality and color before committing to a larger 1 kilogram spool.

  What are the fluorescent colors?

  -Our fluorescent colors shine under black light (UV).
