      [ High-quality PETG filament]: Our Ataraxia 3D Printer PETG filament 1.75mm is made of tough material to enhance the premium quality for stable printing. It has a 1.75mm diameter, carefully wound, superb layer bonding, high purity, and low shrinkage. The advanced formula makes our PETG 3D filament impact strength extremely strong, perfect for printing functional models, special inventions, and strong gadgets.

      [Good Mechanical Properties] - We ensure smooth outflow, easy adhesion of thicker or thinner layers. Selected color: Black PETG filament 1.75mm (PETG Black Filament) Tip: Please make sure - never let go the tip of the filament as it may create nodes. Holes on the side of the spool can be used to prevent this issue.

      [ Thermal Properties for Wide Color Options]: We offer a wide range of 14 panton matched colors of 3D printing filament for your day-to-day engineering tools creations. Colors are like- sky blue, blue, purple, skin, brown,slate gray , baby pink, black, yellow, White, red, light brown, gold, green, and orange. All colors come in cautiously winding 1kg/2.2lb spools.

      [ Tangle-free & Moisture Free]: Our 1.75mm 3d PETG filament is designed & manufactured with an advanced innovative formula to keep it bubble-free patent, odorless, & clog-free. They are carefully winded spool prevents jamming, thread pulling, twisting, adhesion stringing, warping, no cracking & under-extrusion. Our clean finished product gives an excellent round surface stable finish for your Arts & Crafts, DIY, Decoration, festivals, 3d structure, small objects, or big projects.

      [ Extra filament storage bag ]: We offer an extra-strong premium filament vacuum storage bag for future use to keep our flexible PLA filament, PLA plus 1.75mm, PETG filament, wood filament, 3D printer filaments orange, 3D pens refills, silk filaments, rainbow PLA filament, silk tricolor filament - fresh and prevent oxidizing. One bag can hold two filament spools and works with any vacuum cleaner.

      [ Dimensional tolerance accuracy & consistency]: Our PETG filament utilizes advanced ccd diameter measuring system. To avoid any issues, all our filaments are dried for 24 hours before packaging, then vacuum sealed in resealable Ziplock bag with desiccants. Ataraxia 3d petg filaments 1.75mm refill has a strict consistency color & accuracy of +/- 0.02mm. It works perfectly with most FDM 3D printers on the market. Net weight: 1 kg (approximately 2.2 lbs) Spool.

      [ 3D printer & 3D printing settings]: Our PETG 3D filaments made from easy essential raw material, amplify lower melting temp, no odor, no bad smell, and no trouble while using 3D pen or 3D printers. The recommended PETG Filament Settings: extrusion/nozzle temperature 200-240C(392-464F), bed temp 60-80C(140-176F), printing speed 30-70mm/sec. Our premium quality PETG filaments red reel graph indicates how much material is left in the spool.
