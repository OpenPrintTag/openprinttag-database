      [ Advance Premium Quality PLA+ Filament ]: Ataraxia 3D Printer PLA Plus filament features a 1.75mm diameter, carefully wounded each spool, superb layer bonding, high purity & Low shrinkage. Our orderly winded spool makes 3d printing outflow very smooth, stable & adhere thicker or thinner layers easily. Our Advanced formula makes our PLA+ filament impact strength 6 times stronger, perfect to print functional model. Tensile Strength: 60 MPa.

       [ Wide Panton Color Options]: We offer a wide range of 14 panton matched colors of 3D printing filament for your day-to-day creations. The colors are like - Red, Black, Yellow, Gold, Violet, White, Sky Blue, Green, Prusa Orange, Ivory white, Light Brown, Chocolate Brown,Comet & Mercury. All colors come in cautiously winding 1kg/2.2lb spools. Selected color: Black PLA+ filament 1.75mm (Black 3D Printer Filament)

      [Good Mechanical Properties]: Our 3D PLA Filament offers excellent thermal properties, including smooth outflow & easy adhesion of both thick & thin layers. Our innovative formula keeps them tangle-free, bubble-free, odorless & clog-free, with clean finish & stable printing experience. Orderly wounded spool will prevent issues such as jamming, twisting & warping. To avoid nodes from forming, it's important to keep hold of the tip of the filament & utilize the holes on the spool's side.

      [ Cardboard Spool ]: PLA filament is easy to use and comes with a cardboard spool. PLA is the most cost-effective way to bring your creations to life. *Please Note* To avoid nodes from forming, it's important to keep hold of the tip of the filament & utilize the holes on the spool's side. We are in transition period of changing spool.

      [Extra Filament Storage Bag t]: We include an extra premium filament storage bag to protect the moisture of all our flexible PLA Black, PLA+ Green, Light Brown PLA 1.75mm, Petg filament, Wood filament, 3d Printer filaments white, Silk Filaments, Rainbow PLA filament. All our PLA filament comes in sealed packages with desiccants to keep them fresh and prevent oxidization. One bag can hold two filament spools and works with any vacuum cleaner.

      [Dimensional Tolerance Accuracy & Consistency]: Ataraxia Art PLA Filament Black utilizes advanced CCD diameter measuring, drying for 24 hours before packaging, and vacuum sealing with desiccants and a self-adaptive control system guarantees strict tolerance. Our sturdy PLA+ filament measures 1.75 mm in diameter with dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.03mm and a net weight of 1kg (approximately 2.2 lbs) per spool, making it compatible with most FDM 3D printers on the market.

      [ 3D Printer & 3D Printing Setting ]: Our 3D PLA filaments are made with easy quality essential materials. PLA Nozzle settings are recommended at 190-220C (374 - 428F), Bed Temperature at 40-60C (104-140F), and Printing Speed at 60-120 mm/Sec. NOTE: Our PLA filaments red reel graph indicates how much material is left in the spool. Our strong PLA filaments have lower melting temperatures, no odor & no smell.

      [ Lifetime Support & Risk-Free Flexible PLA ]: We will provide all the technical guidance with All of our 3D Printer Printing Filaments & 3d Pen pla refills Products. Any suggestion or feedback are welcome on amazon prime. Our black PLA flexible filaments are compatible with most fdm 3D printers that use 1.75mm diameter filament on the market. Our PLA is compatible with all the 3d printers and 3d pens on the market, easily used as a beginner, advanced, and expert friendly as well.
