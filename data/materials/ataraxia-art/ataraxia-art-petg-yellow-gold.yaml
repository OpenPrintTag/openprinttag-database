      [ High-quality PETG filament]: Our Ataraxia 3D Printer PETG filament 1.75mm is made of tough material to enhance the premium quality for stable printing. It has a 1.75mm diameter, carefully wound, superb layer bonding, high purity, and low shrinkage. The advanced formula makes our PETG 3D filament impact strength extremely strong, perfect for printing functional models, special inventions, and strong gadgets.

      [Good Mechanical Properties] - We ensure smooth outflow, easy adhesion of thicker or thinner layers. Selected color: Gold PETG filament 1.75mm (PETG Gold Filament) Tip: Please make sure - never let go the tip of the filament as it may create nodes. Holes on the side of the spool can be used to prevent this issue.

      [ Thermal Properties for Wide Color Options]: We offer a wide range of 14 panton matched colors of 3D printing filament for your day-to-day engineering tools creations. Colors are like- sky blue, blue, purple, skin, brown, pink, black, yellow, White, red, light brown, gold, green, and orange. All colors come in cautiously winding 1kg/2.2lb spools. We offer 2 gold color - yellow gold and copper mix gold color
