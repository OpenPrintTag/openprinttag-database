      [ Rapid Turbo Fast Printing Power 60-600 mm/s] : Supercharge your creativity with Ataraxia Art Hyper PLA filaments 1. 75mm. Experience groundbreaking 3D printing speeds ranging from 60 to 600mm/s or achieve an impressive M.V.S (Material Volumetric Speed) of (19-21) mm3/s with Ataraxia Art's Turbo High-Speed PLA filament.

      [ Why Choose Ataraxia Art HS PLA Plus] : High fluidity is designed to print quickly, sufficient melting, high efficiency, and extrusion, while rapid cooling provides quick turnaround, fast shaping, durable good surface finish for smooth high-speed printing. Full mechanical winding and detailed manual inspection ensures that all high-speed pla plus filaments are tidy winded, which effectively reduces tangles, snap, and line breakage issues.

      [ Wide Color Options]: We offer 5 vibrant beautiful colors in our high speed 3d Printer pla Filaments for your day-to-day projects, which is perfect for printing a multi range of objects, including figurines, prototypes. Available Popular Choices are - Red, Black, White, Sky Blue and Gray. All colors come in thoughtfully wound on 1kg/2.2lb spools. Your Selected color: Red Turbo HS PLA+ filament 1.75mm (PLA Red Filament 1.75mm)

      [Dimensional Tolerance Accuracy & Consistency]: Ataraxia Art Turbo Hyper PLA Filament Red utilizes advanced CCD diameter measurement, 24-hour pre-packaging drying & vacuum sealing with desiccants. The self-adaptive control system ensures strict tolerance. Our HS PLA+ filament, with a diameter of 1.75 mm and a dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.02mm, weight 1kg per spool (approximately 2.2 lbs). This precision guarantees meticulous detail & consistent accuracy in replicating your 3D models.

      [Increased Strength Less Hassle]: Ataraxia Art Turbo High Speed Filament 1.75 mm has higher tensile strength and toughness than any traditional PLA/PLA +/PLA Plus/PLA Pro 3d printing filament. It adds extra strength to your 3D-printed models. The Turbo rapid PLA Plus filament is flexible and less prone to breaking, making it great for functional parts. The high speed PLA+ filament has improved strength and durability, ideal for tough prints that need to withstand impact.

      [ 3D Printers Setting ]: Our 3D PLA filaments are made with easy quality essential large materials. PLA Nozzle settings are recommended at 190-220C (374 - 428F), Bed Temperature at 40-60C (104-140F), and Printing Speed at 60-120 mm/Sec. NOTE: Our PLA filaments red reel graph indicates how much material is left in the spool. Our strong PLA filaments have lower melting temperatures, increase productivity, no odor & no smell.

      [ Universal 3D Printer Compatibility] : Explore your innovation with Ataraxia Art Turbo Hyper PLA Filament 1.75mm! This versatile PLA offers improved toughness and fluidity, compatible with most 1.75mm 3D printers on the market. (either regular 3d printer or high speed 3d printers with heated beds). Turbo PLA Plus is engineered for seamless integration, it fits various FDM 3D printers, including faster model printers like Neptune, Ender series, Kobra 2, bamboo and more.

      [Complimentary Filament Storage Bag]: We provide an additional premium transparent filament storage bag to safeguard the moisture levels of our Ataraxia 3D Printer Filaments like flexible pla, rainbow multicolor silk pla. All our rapid PLA filaments are sealed with desiccants to maintain freshness, no dust , prevent oxidation & being damaged or polluted during transportation. Each bag accommodates two filament spools & is compatible with any vacuum cleaner.

      [Technical Support & Risk-Free Turbo PLA ]: We offer all kind of technical support to all our 3D printing fpla Consumables or 3d pen pla refills. Any suggestion or support about Hyper PLA Filament 1.75 mm, is welcome on amazon prime message center. We design turbo high-speed pla process easily to beginner, Seasoned, advanced, and expert friendly as well.
