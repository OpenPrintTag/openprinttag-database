description: |-
  iglide® RW370-PF is an abrasion-resistant, high-temperature tribo-filament which was specifically developed for use in railway vehicles. As such, its fire retardant specifications conform to UL94-V0 and EN45545. In addition, it has the maximum mechanical strength of all tribofilaments and a long-term temperature resistance of 170°C, which makes it the material of choice for high-temperature applications. Due to its high processing temperature of 350-360°C and a mandatory installation space temperature of min. 160°C, a high-temperature 3D printer is required for processing. The filament is very sensitive to moisture and should be stored in a drying container and actively dried regularly. iglide® RW370 is also available as injection molded and bar stock material.

  When to use it?

      When the application requires high temperature resistance
      When the mechanical strength of the other tribo-filaments is not sufficient
      When fire-retardant specifications are required
      From prototype to series: the same material for 3D printing, bar stock and injection molding

  When not to use it?

      When your existing 3D printer does not have a build chamber heater (→ iglide i180)
      When very high wear resistance at high-temperature load is required (→ iglide A350)
