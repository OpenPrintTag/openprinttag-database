  High-strength filament for structural components or as a material partner for multi-material components

  igumid® P150 is an extremely strong and stiff 3D printing filament due to fiber reinforcement. It was specially developed as a partner material for iglidur i150 for the production of very strong and at the same time friction-optimized components in multi-material printing. Furthermore, it can be used for printing strong structural components. Thanks to the high strength and high rigidity, igumid® P150 is ideal for lightweight construction with low material requirements. 

  igumid® P150 can be purchased as filament for processing with your own printer or ordered at 3D printing service via STEP file as a stand-alone component or as a 2K component in combination with iglide® i150.Because of the abrasive fibers, the used printer to process the filament should have a wear-resistant (e.g. hardened) nozzle and extruder pinion. For better adhesion to the printing plate, the bonding agent for tribofilaments can be used.
