  High-strength filament for structural components or as a material partner for multi-material components

  igumid® P190 is an extremely strong and stiff 3D printed filament due to the reinforcement with carbon fiber. It was specially developed as a partner material for iglide i190 for the production of very strong and at the same time friction-optimized components in multi-material printing. Furthermore, it can be used for printing stable structural components. Thanks to the high strength and high rigidity, igumid® P190 is ideal for lightweight construction with low material requirements. 

  igumid® P190 can be purchased as filament for processing with your own printer or ordered at 3D printing service via STEP file as a stand-alone component or as a 2K component in combination with iglide® i190.  Because of the abrasive fibers, the used printer to process the filament should have a wear-resistant (for example hardened) nozzle and extruder pinion. The bonding agent for tribofilaments can be used for better adhesion to the printing plate. The filament is very sensitive to moisture and should be stored in a drying container and actively dried regularly.

  When to use it?

      For structural components where high strength and stiffness are required
      For special mounting brackets for cable carriers
      As a multi-material partner with iglide® i190, for the combination of a high-strength material (igumid® P190) and a particularly durable plastic (iglide® i190)


  When not to use it?

      For friction and wear applications (→ iglide i150 or iglide i180 or iglide i190)
      If the application requires a food-grade material (→ iglide i150 or iglide i151-PF or iglide A350)
      If the application temperature is higher than 120°C in the long term (→ iglidur A350 or iglide® RW370-PF)
