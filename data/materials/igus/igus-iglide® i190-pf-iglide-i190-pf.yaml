description: |-
  Flexurally high strength and wear-resistant filament - iglide i190
   
  iglide i190-PF is characterised by high wear resistance as the material is enriched with solid lubricants. It can be processed on regular 3D printers, but a closed 3D printer is recommended. Due to its high wear resistance and excellent mechanical specifications (strength, toughness, coating adhesion), it is an all-round material that is suitable for most applications and 3D printers. Of all igus tribo-filaments, only iglide RW370 has a higher strength than iglide i190, making iglide i190 the tribo-filament with the highest strength that can be processed on regular 3D printers. With the bonding agent for tribo-filaments, iglide i190 can be processed on conventional print bed surfaces (e.g. glass).
   
  When to use it?

      For all types of applications where low friction and high wear resistance are important
      If an easy to process tribo-filament is required.
      When higher strengths are required.

  When not to use it?

      If the application temperature is higher than 90°C in the long term (iglide J260 or iglide RW370-PF)
      For applications under water or with high humidity (iglide i180-PF)
      If the application requires a food grade material (iglide i150-PF or iglide A350)
      When an even easier to process tribo-filament is required (iglide l150-PF)
