  The food conformity declarations and data sheets for the iglide® A350 can be found in the download area.

  Food-safe high-temperature filament, FDA-compliant

  iglide A350 is an abrasion-resistant, high-temperature filament developed for the food and packaging industry. As such, the raw material is compliant with EU 10/2011 and FDA food contact regulations and has the industry standard blue color. It is temperature-resistant up to 180 °C, fire-retardant according to UL94-V0 and can be sterilized with super-heated steam. Due to its high processing temperature of 340 – 360 °C and a compulsory installation temperature of min. 160 °C, a high-temperature 3D printer is required for processing.
  The filament is very sensitive to moisture and should be stored in a drying container and actively dried regularly. iglide A350 is available as injection molding material, bar stock and 3D printing material.

  Tip: iglide A350 complies with the fire prevention requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration of the USA (FAA) for aircraft interiors.

  When to use it?

      For applications in the food industry with high application temperatures of up to 180°C
      From prototype to volume production: iglide A350 is available as 3D printing filament, bar stock, and injection molding material

  When not to use it?

      When high wear resistance at high temperature loads is required
      If, in addition to high application temperatures, high strength is also required, or complex parts are to be produced (→ iglide RW370)
      If your existing 3D printer does not have a build chamber heater (→ iglide i151)
