description: |-
  The ASAx CF filament from Nobufil is made from recycled production waste and thus makes a valuable contribution to the circular economy. As an alternative to 3D materials from primary production, these products help to conserve resources, reduce the ecological footprint and reduce CO2 emissions. By adding recycled carbon fibers, both the strength and rigidity of the printed components are significantly improved.

  However, compared to ABS filament, ASA offers some clear advantages, such as higher UV resistance and better resistance to chemicals and high temperatures.

  The physical properties of Nobufil ASA include high tensile strength and stiffness.

  Due to its durability and good weather resistance, Nobufil ASA 3D Filament is ideal for exterior signs, automotive components, functional applications and much more.


  Our ASA carbon filament prints with almost no warping, is odorless and can be easily processed on almost all common 3D printers. These properties make it the ideal material for beginners, ambitious hobby printers and professional series production. This makes this material the first choice for anyone who wants to produce structural components with an improved modulus of elasticity, excellent surface quality, dimensional stability, low weight and easy printability.

  ASAx CF is a durable, high-quality, 10% carbon fibre-reinforced ASA filament made from recycled industrial waste from Europe. We have made every effort to create a predictable, high-quality material for you. This 3D material is suitable for printing engineering parts with FDM technology.

   

  Make an eco-friendly choice without compromising on quality and price!
