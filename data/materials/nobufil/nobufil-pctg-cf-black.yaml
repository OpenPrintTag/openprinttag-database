description: |-
  Nobufil PCTG filament is made from recycled plastics, which are production waste that arises during industrial processing.

   PCTG (polycyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate glycol-modified) is a polymer from the polyester family and has a much higher impact resistance than its better-known counterpart PETG. This makes the material suitable for components that are exposed to the highest mechanical loads.

  The PCTG material can be printed with an open build space and is therefore also suitable for use with common desktop 3D printers. The properties of PCTG filament are a perfect combination of high strength and easy processing.

   - High impact resistance for mechanically stressed components

   - Easy to print even with open build space

   - Low odor and warping

   - High chemical resistance
