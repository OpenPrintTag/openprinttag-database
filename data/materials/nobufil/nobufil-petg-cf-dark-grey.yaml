description: |-
  Nobufil's PETG CF filament is made from recycled production waste and thus makes a valuable contribution to the circular economy. As an alternative to materials from primary production, these products help to conserve resources, reduce the ecological footprint and reduce CO2 emissions. By adding recycled carbon fibers, both the strength and rigidity of the printed components are significantly improved.

   PETG is a material known for its resistance to chemicals and moisture, making it a good carbon fiber composite for parts exposed to such exposure.

   The PETG CF filament can be used, for example, for components that come into contact with coolants or lubricants, or for outdoor applications.

  Our PETG carbon filament prints with almost no warping, is odorless and can be easily processed on almost all common 3D printers. These properties make it the ideal material for beginners, ambitious hobby printers and professional series production. This makes this material the first choice for anyone who wants to produce structural components with an improved modulus of elasticity, excellent surface quality, dimensional stability, low weight and easy printability.

  PETG CF is a sustainable high quality 10% carbon fiber reinforced PETG filament made from recycled industrial waste sourced in Europe. We took great care to create a predictable high-quality 3D printing material for you to enjoy. This material is suitable to print technical parts using FDM technology.

  Choose your eco-friendly high-quality 3D printing filament without sacrificing quality and price!
