description: |-
  nobufil PETG filament is made from recycled production waste and thus makes a valuable contribution to the circular economy. As an alternative to materials from primary production, these products help to conserve resources, reduce the ecological footprint and reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, filament made from nobufil PETG delivers high-quality prints with excellent layer adhesion and robustness. The good durability is combined with high impact resistance, making it an ideal material for the production of objects that are exposed to mechanical stress. Other strengths of this material are excellent layer adhesion and almost the same properties as ABS in terms of temperature resistance and strength - at the same time, it is just as easy to print as PLA.

   The PETG filament prints with almost no warping, is odorless and can be easily processed on almost all common 3D printers. These properties make it the ideal material for beginners, ambitious hobby printers and professional series production.
