      High Elasticity: FLASHFORGE flexible is more elastic than TPU and can stretch up to four times its original length. It's ideal for making insoles, arts & crafts, DIY projects, phone cases, belts, and decorations.

      Easy Printing: FLASHFORGE Flexible PLA is beginner-friendly and works with both Bowden and direct drive extruders, though Bowden setups may need adjustments.

      Premium Filaments: Our filament is engineered for smooth, clog-free printing. It is dried for 24 hours before packaging and vacuum-sealed to minimize bubbles caused by humidity.

      Dimensional Accuracy: Advanced measurement systems ensure 99% of the filament has a diameter of 1.75mm +/- 0.02mm for high-quality prints.

      No Special Settings Needed: Flexible PLA is easier to print than other flexible materials and typically doesn't require heated beds or special nozzle settings, reducing warping and improving accuracy.
