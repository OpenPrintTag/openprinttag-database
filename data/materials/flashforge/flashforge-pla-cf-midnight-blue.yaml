      Enhanced Strength and Rigidity: PLA-CF contains a high percentage of carbon fiber, significantly improving the mechanical strength and rigidity of printed parts, especially those that need to bear pressure and load.

      Lightweight: Despite its increased strength, PLA-CF remains lightweight, making it ideal for applications in aerospace, automotive, and other industries where weight is critical.

      Improved Wear Resistance: The inclusion of carbon fiber provides PLA-CF with higher wear resistance, making it suitable for parts that experience frequent friction, such as gears and bearings.

      Easy to Print: Compared to other carbon fiber-reinforced materials, PLA-CF shares similar printing properties with regular PLA and doesn't require special printing conditions such as high bed temperatures or nozzle heat, making it easier to print.

      Low Warping and Smooth Finish: PLA-CF maintains PLA's low shrinkage and warping, ensuring better dimensional stability during printing. Its carbon fiber content provides a smooth, matte surface, making it ideal for both functional and aesthetic parts.
