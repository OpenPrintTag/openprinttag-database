      Adored Chameleon Filament Series - A color-changing material responsive to different light and angles. This filament is composed of special pigments that can perfectly conceal layer lines, allowing you to create stunning visual effects in your 3D printed creations. This series includes five colors: Burnt Titanium, Nebula Purple, Skydiver Blue, Rose Quartz, and Obsidian.

      Ease of Use and Versatility - PLA is renowned for its user-friendliness, low printing temperature, and strong adhesion to common print surfaces. FLASHFORGE PLA Filament uses high-quality raw materials, ensuring perfect prints even with default settings. It also offers a variety of color options, including the beloved Chameleon series PLA.

      Low Warping and Minimal Odor - FLASHFORGE PLA has a low shrinkage rate and minimal warping, allowing for exceptionally smooth surfaces. This makes it well-suited for indoor use and ideal for creating intricate and detailed prints, making it a perfect choice for artistic and decorative items. Additionally, it emits very little odor during the printing process.

      Clog-Free, Bubble-Free - The filament is designed to be clog-free and bubble-free, ensuring a smooth and stable printing experience. It is dried for 24 hours, vacuum-sealed, and undergoes quality checks before leaving the factory.

      Precision and Consistency - Advanced CCD diameter measurement and adaptive control systems ensure that 99% of the filament has a diameter of 1.75 mm with a tolerance of +/- 0.02 mm. Each spool contains 1 kg (2.2 lbs) of filament.
