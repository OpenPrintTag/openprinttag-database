      [Carbon Fiber PLA Filament]It is produced by carbon fiber reinforced PLA material. The carbon fiber increases the toughness of the material, and in the meantime dramatically reduces the shrinkage of the material. When printing, you only need the ordinary heating platform without the thermal. Uniform-sized printing cavity, good interlayer bonding, and smooth surface.

      [Premium Product Performance]It is a composite material with 10% carbon fiber added in PLA, therefore the strength, rigidity, and temperature resistance of the material are improved. The printed model features a bright luster, and the support is easier to remove.

      [Clog-Free & Bubble-Free]Manufactured using clog-resistant methods to guarantee a seamless and steady printing experience with these PLA filaments. Thoroughly dried for 24 hours before packaging and vacuum sealed with desiccant to safeguard the filament from moisture and achieve precise printing.

      [Tangle-Free and Easy for Using]Automatic winding with supplementary manual detection, to ensure that the line is tidy and less tangled to avoid possible snagging and line breakage. Additionally, FLASHFORGE PLA 1.75mm filament offers enhanced flowability and is compatible with 99% of FDM 3D printers available on the market.

      [After-sales Support]All flashforge 3d printer filaments are provided a two-month warranty and also a 30-day Money-back if you are not satisfied. We provide 24-hour online customer service, if you have any questions regarding product issues please feel free to contact us.
