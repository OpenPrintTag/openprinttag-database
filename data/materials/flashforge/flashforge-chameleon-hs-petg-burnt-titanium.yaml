      [Toughness PETG Filaments]FLASHFORGE PETG is an immensely popular 3D printing filament, widely used for its high strength, relative flexibility, and temperature resistance compared to the ever-popular PLA. It's measured in many of the same ways as ABS but is generally much easier to work with and has the added benefit of being safe.

      [Clog-Free & Bubble-Free]Manufactured using clog-resistant methods to guarantee a seamless and steady printing experience with these PLA filaments. Thoroughly dried for 24 hours before packaging and vacuum sealed with desiccant to safeguard the filament from moisture and achieve precise printing.

      [Tangle-Free and Easy for Using]Automatic winding with supplementary manual detection, to ensure that the line is tidy and less tangled to avoid possible snagging and line breakage. Additionally, FLASHFORGE PLA 1.75mm filament offers enhanced flowability and is compatible with 99% of FDM 3D printers available on the market.

      [High Printing Performance]FLASHFORGE 3D printer filament 1.75mm PLA is designed to meet the needs of highly detailed printing and ensure a consistent color, dimensional accuracy, and no warping, no jamming, or layer delamination issues. It provides the best printing experience for 3D printing enthusiasts.

      [After-sales Support]All flashforge 3d printer filaments are provided a two-month warranty and also a 30-day Money-back if you are not satisfied. We provide 24-hour online customer service, if you have any questions regarding product issues please feel free to contact us.
