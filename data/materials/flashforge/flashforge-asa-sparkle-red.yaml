      Unique Shimmering Effect - FLASHFORGE Sparkle ASA filament contains tiny silver flakes, offering a visually captivating sparkle effect that adds a unique texture and appearance to your prints. Due to the addition of these flakes, it is recommended to use a 0.6mm nozzle for printing

      High UV Resistance - FLASHFORGE ASA UV filament combines the properties of traditional ABS filament with enhanced high-temperature resistance. It is UV stable, meaning it doesn't suffer from significant shrinking.

      Excellent Temperature Resistance - FLASHFORGE ASA maintains its shape and integrity up to temperatures near 93degreesC. This makes it particularly suitable for printing objects intended for long-term outdoor use, such as RC planes or car accessories.

      Chemical Resistance - ASA exhibits good resistance to many chemicals, including oils and solvents, making it an excellent choice for applications that require chemical stability.

      Clog-Free, Bubble-Free: The filament is designed to be clog-free and bubble-free, ensuring a smooth and stable printing experience. It is dried for 24 hours, vacuum-sealed, and undergoes quality checks before leaving the factory.
