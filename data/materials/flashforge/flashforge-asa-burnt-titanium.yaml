      New color Burnt Titanium - FLASHFORGE chameleon series filament, a color-changing material responsive to different light and angles. This filament is composed of special pigments that can perfectly conceal layer lines, allowing you to create stunning visual effects in your 3D printed creations.

      High UV Resistance - FLASHFORGE ASA UV filament combines the properties of traditional ABS filament with enhanced high-temperature resistance. It is UV stable, meaning it doesn't suffer from significant shrinking.

      Excellent Temperature Resistance - FLASHFORGE ASA maintains its shape and integrity up to temperatures near 93degreesC. This makes it particularly suitable for printing objects intended for long-term outdoor use, such as RC planes or car accessories.

      Chemical Resistance - ASA exhibits good resistance to many chemicals, including oils and solvents, making it an excellent choice for applications that require chemical stability.

      Clog-Free, Bubble-Free: The filament is designed to be clog-free and bubble-free, ensuring a smooth and stable printing experience. It is dried for 24 hours, vacuum-sealed, and undergoes quality checks before leaving the factory.
