description: |-
  Elevate your 3D printing creations with the unparalleled quality of PLA INGEO 850 Filament. Exceptionally crafted for the discerning enthusiast, this filament harmonises the simplicity of PLA with the robustness akin to ABS. Revel in its splendid ease of printing and superior adhesion properties, ensuring each layer bonds flawlessly, as depicted in the sleek black sheen of our product image. The exceptional adhesion properties of PLA INGEO 850 contribute to reduced warping and improved overall print quality, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced 3D printing enthusiasts alike.

  Engineered for endurance, this tough PLA showcases a remarkable impact resistance that can be further enhanced via a straightforward crystallisation process. Subject it to 120°C for a mere 15-20 minutes, and witness a transformation that bestows upon your prints a glass transition temperature soaring to 85°C - rivaling ABS with a 15% increase in impact resilience. This unique characteristic of PLA INGEO 850 sets it apart from standard PLA filaments, offering a level of durability previously associated only with more challenging materials. The enhanced impact resistance makes it suitable for functional prototypes and end-use parts that require both strength and precision.

  Ideal for both intricate prototypes and durable end-use parts, PLA INGEO 850 Filament stands as a testament to innovation in 3D printing materials. Whether crafting bespoke jewellery or engineering components, this filament delivers with striking precision and strength. The versatility of PLA INGEO 850 extends to various applications, from architectural models to consumer products, offering consistent performance across different print settings and environmental conditions. Make the switch to PLA INGEO 850; it's not just a choice, it's an investment in excellence that will elevate your 3D printing projects to new heights of quality and durability.
