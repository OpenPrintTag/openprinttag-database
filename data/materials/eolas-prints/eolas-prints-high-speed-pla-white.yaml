description: |-
  This speed pla filament is specifically formulated for high-speed printing, enabling users to significantly reduce production times. It provides a solution for rapid 3d printing without compromising exceptional quality or precision, even at speeds up to 300mm/s.

  Engineered with enhanced material properties, this filament exhibits nearly double the strength of standard PLA. Its superior mechanical performance includes impact resistance comparable to that of ABS, ensuring durable and reliable parts. The formulation allows for rapid cooling and consistent extrusion, resulting in an extraordinary surface quality and detailed model reproduction.

  Ideal for industrial design, functional prototyping, and precision engineering, this filament provides structural integrity for demanding applications. It is produced using food-contact safe ingredients and allows for post-annealing to further improve its thermal properties and overall strength.
