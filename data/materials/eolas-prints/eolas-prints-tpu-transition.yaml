description: |-
  Discover the innovative TPU Transition Filament, a groundbreaking material for 3D printing enthusiasts seeking to create visually striking and environmentally conscious prints. This unique filament, offered by Eolas Prints, seamlessly blends multiple colors during the transition process, resulting in eye-catching, gradient-like effects that set your creations apart. The TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) composition ensures flexibility and durability, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications.

  The TPU Transition Filament not only produces stunning visual results but also contributes to sustainable 3D printing practices. By utilizing the color transition phase during manufacturing, this filament significantly reduces waste and minimizes the carbon footprint associated with traditional filament production methods. This eco-friendly approach aligns with the growing demand for environmentally responsible materials in the 3D printing industry.

  Whether you're a novice exploring the world of 3D printing or an experienced maker looking to expand your material options, TPU Transition Filament offers versatility and ease of use. Its flexible nature allows for the creation of both rigid and pliable objects, opening up new possibilities for functional prototypes, custom parts, and artistic endeavors.
  Why Transition Filament?

  During the colour change in the manufacturing process, filaments are produced that are a mixture of two colours and these filaments are called transition filaments. By doing this, the carbon footprint is reduced by eliminating the waste that would be produced at each colour change. In addition, this filament gives a unique look to each piece.
