  Pros
  Reduce the weight of printed parts up to 65% compared to regular PLA.

  Control extruded volume of material by regulating printing temperature. At around 230C LW-PLA starts foaming and can increase its volume by nearly 3 times.

  With one spool LW-PLA you can print as much as with 3 regular spools of PLA, due to the 3x lower material multiplier / flow.

  Easy to cut, trim, sand and takes paint really well.

  LW-PLA  (Natural,Black,Gray Silver & Red) hides layer lines really well.

  Cons
   Material oozes on travelmoves, this is normal and can't be reduced completely.

   Color will turn lighter when material is at maximum foamed state as opposed to non-foamed state which shows a deeper and richer color.

  This is what our customer are saying about this material:
  -"...Must have material for RC planes! Light, easy to print, can cut and trim, too"
  -"...LW-PLA, it's perhaps the most ingenious 3D printer filament on the market."
  -"...So far I have used this for cosplay and the weight reduction is amazing"
  -"...This filament creates strong, lightweight parts with great surface finish and it sands very well (better than normal PLA)"
  -"...I've been using this filament for various decorative prints to be worn, and the weight reduction is a real advantage!"
  -.."Ideal for Drone replacement parts"
