description: |-
  And when the lights go out, there is glowFill. When you print it, with regular lights on or during the day, it is a very nice, creamy filament with a very smooth finish. Nice as it is, it changes when the lights go out. Then you will see it glow. A special highly concentrated phosphorescent pigment is matched with our PLA/PHA compound, so it'll print just like our other PLA/PHA 3D printing filaments. It is by far one of the most fun filaments which can lead to some fantastic prints.

  Innovation never stops at colorFabb. Our ever expanding range of special filaments have been industry leading for years. Some of them are for aesthetic purposes, others are pure functionality or for specific niche applications. Materials like woodFill, bronzeFill, XT-CF20, LW-PLA, varioShore TPU and DPA-100 support filament were developed in-house and have been successes ever since. By listening to our customers' needs and forging strategic partnerships with material OEMs we are able to innovate continuously and bring FDM/FFF 3D printing to the next level.

  Please note that most materials have specific printing instructions. Consult the individual article pages for more information.
