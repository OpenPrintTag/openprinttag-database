description: |-
  Discover the versatility and value of colorFabb's TPU 95A filament, a smart addition to any 3D printing portfolio. Designed with affordability and performance in mind, this filament offers a compelling solution for a wide range of applications which need a semi-flexible material.

  TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) 95A stands out for its exceptional semi-flexibility and print-ability, offering a balanced blend of flexibility, elasticity and ease-of-printing. With a Shore hardness of 95A, it delivers reliable performance across various printing projects.

  While TPU 95A offers exceptional value, it does require careful attention during printing. Achieving proper bed adhesion and fine-tuning print settings are essential for optimal results. We also advice our customers to process the TPU as dry as possible, drying the TPU at 70c for 6-9 hours in a warm air dehydrator works well.

  Add colorFabb's TPU 95A filament to your arsenal and unlock new possibilities in 3D printing. Elevate your creations without breaking the bank, and embrace the future of additive manufacturing today.
