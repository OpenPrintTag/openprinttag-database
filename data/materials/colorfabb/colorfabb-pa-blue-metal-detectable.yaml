  To assist the food processing industry with the best 3D printing filament possible we developed a blue colored polyamide which is also metal detectable.

  Visual contrast is key. Blue is chosen as a common color for plastic materials in the food processing industry because it offers high visual contrast against most food products. This makes it easier for workers and vison systems to detect any plastic fragments that may accidently contaminate the food product during processing.

  Additionally our filament is metal detectable to minimize the risk of product contamination. Any plastic fragment which may accidently contaminate the food during the processing can be detected down-stream with metal detectors.

   

  Disclaimer:Please be advised that the metal particles integrated into our product are designed for detection by specialized metal detection equipment used in the food industry. Standard household magnets or basic metal detectors may not reliably detect these particles. Our materials are optimized for advanced metal detection systems like electromagnetic induction and X-ray inspection. For accurate detection, we recommend using appropriate equipment designed for the food processing environment.

      Metal detectable
      EU food contact compliance
      Signature blue color

  Food Safety Compliance. Our compound raw material has been approved for food contact according to: Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004 in terms of specific measures for groups of materials - in this case, plastics - in form of Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011.

  Furthermore, the product is in accordance with the Regulation (EC) No. 2023/2006 (Article 5, 6, and 7). The components and monomers of the product are listed in the Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 and amendments.

  The suitability of the finished article for the intended use (food contact) must be checked by the manufacturer or seller of the 3D printed parts.

   Overall, the use of blue color and metal detectability in 3D printing filaments for the food processing industry is a proactive approach to prevent, detect, and mitigate potential product contamination. These features contribute to maintaining high food safety standards, protecting consumer health, and ensuring the integrity of food production processes.

  Pros

  Metal detectable.

  Signature blue color.

  PA based, tough parts.

  Cons
  Needs to be dry before printing.

  More sensitive to warping / shrinkage compared to PLA.
