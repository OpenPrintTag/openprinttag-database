description: |+
  We have taken TPU... and made it special by using the same foaming technology we debuted with LW-PLA. Our varioShore TPU has a few main distinctive features: its variable shore hardness, reduced weight and density and soft touch. varioShore TPU allows users to vary the density of the material by adjusting temperature and material throughput (speed & layerheight). At temperatures between 200 and 250C the materials will start to expand to roughly 1.4-1.6 times its original volume, which reduces the density to 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm3. This means the material can be printed at low flow rates (60-70%), to compensate the active foaming, which in return gives very soft printed parts. Between 190-200C the material can be printed without foaming, resulting in different haptics and harder prints compared to foamed samples.

  From shore hardness 92A(unfoamed) to shore 55A (maximum foamed).

  Developed in co-operation with Lubrizol, varioShore TPU is a material ideally suited for printing cosplay parts for instance.

  Please note that color variations may occur. Color will turn lighter when material is at maximum foamed state as opposed to non-foamed state which shows a deeper and richer color.
