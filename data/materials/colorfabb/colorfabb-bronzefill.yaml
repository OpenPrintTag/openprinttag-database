  The first of its kind: a filament with actual metal in it, as highly dosed as physically possible, for FDM/FFF 3D printing. With bronzeFill you have a 3D printing filament in your hands that astonishes. Not only the look and feel, which turns your print into art, but also the weight - which is about three to four times as heavy as regular PLA. Based on our PLA/PHA formulation bronzeFill has a matte, almost laser sintered finished. Only when you polish it, or use another way of post-processing, you make it truly shine and will turn your print into a piece that, according to a certain archeologist, belongs in a museum.

  Users have printed some very cool examples, like the Octolamp and an ancient Greek helmet. Or look back at our retrospective 5 Years bronzeFill we posted in 2019.

  Innovation never stops at colorFabb. Our ever expanding range of special filaments have been industry leading for years. Some of them are for aesthetic purposes, others are pure functionality or for specific niche applications. Materials like woodFill, bronzeFill, XT-CF20, LW-PLA, varioShore TPU and DPA-100 support filament were developed in-house and have been successes ever since. By listening to our customers' needs and forging strategic partnerships with material OEMs we are able to innovate continuously and bring FDM/FFF 3D printing to the next level.

  Please note that most materials have specific printing instructions. Consult the individual article pages for more information.
