  After printing the LW-ASA Black will turn slightly lighter shade of black.  When foamed the surface finish will also turn matte, which gives a very professional looking result. Due to higher temperature resistance of LW-ASA you don't need to worry about heat absorption.

  The LW-ASA material is capable of increasing its volume nearly 2,5 times. The filament density is close to 1,07 g/cm3 but when foamed at its maximum capacity users will achieve part density close to 0,43 g/cm3.

  After printing the LW-ASA Black will turn slightly lighter shade of black.  When foamed the surface finish will also turn matte, which gives a very professional looking result. Due to higher temperature resistance of LW-ASA you don't need to worry about heat absorption.

  LW-ASA is more susceptible to warping compared to LW-PLA type filament. Especially models with a large footprint can shrink and warp during printing, but compared to ABS in most cases less severe.

  Please note that color variations may occur. Color will turn lighter when material is at maximum foamed state as opposed to non-foamed state which shows a deeper and richer color.
