description: |-
  A most welcome variation on the woodFill filament. With corkFill we have opted for specifically sourced cork, combined with our PLA/PHA material. Its dark brown color compliments the lighter woodFill and makes for a great addition to your filament collection. You can give your prints a special look, like it was part of nature.

  Innovation never stops at colorFabb. Our ever expanding range of special filaments have been industry leading for years. Some of them are for aesthetic purposes, others are pure functionality or for specific niche applications. Materials like woodFill, bronzeFill, XT-CF20, LW-PLA, varioShore TPU and DPA-100 support filament were developed in-house and have been successes ever since. By listening to our customers' needs and forging strategic partnerships with material OEMs we are able to innovate continuously and bring FDM/FFF 3D printing to the next level.

  Please note that most materials have specific printing instructions. Consult the individual article pages for more information.
