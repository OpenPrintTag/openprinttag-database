  As a variation on bronzeFill copperFill is a true stunner. Now you can print with copper on your desktop 3D printer! The true value of this PLA/PHA based 3D printing filament comes to light when you sand and polish your print. It transforms from a red-brown clay like print into a work of art. With the added weight of real copper in the filament, copperFill is the perfect material for statues and other mementos that need to have a non-printed look.

  Innovation never stops at colorFabb. Our ever expanding range of special filaments have been industry leading for years. Some of them are for aesthetic purposes, others are pure functionality or for specific niche applications. Materials like woodFill, bronzeFill, XT-CF20, LW-PLA, varioShore TPU and DPA-100 support filament were developed in-house and have been successes ever since. By listening to our customers' needs and forging strategic partnerships with material OEMs we are able to innovate continuously and bring FDM/FFF 3D printing to the next level.

  Please note that most materials have specific printing instructions. Consult the individual article pages for more information.
