      Ultra-high-speed printing: The conventional printing speed of PXA ranges from 100-750mm/s, and the maximum printing speed can reach over 1200mm/s (tested on self-assembled machines).
      Excellent molding effect: Regardless of the printing speed, PXA ensures perfect molding results, maintaining consistent quality at both low and high speeds.
      High strength and good toughness: PXA boasts outstanding mechanical properties, with high strength and good toughness, making the printed parts more durable and reliable.
      Low printing temperature and low shrinkage: PXA has a printing temperature of 200-230degreesC, which is lower than other materials, and it also has a low shrinkage rate. This reduces the risk of deformation after printing and eliminates the need for a sealed box.
      Good material stability: PXA is chemically stable, not prone to degradation, and has excellent weather resistance, making it suitable for long-term storage and use.
