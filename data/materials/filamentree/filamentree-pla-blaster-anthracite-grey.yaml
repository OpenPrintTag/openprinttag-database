description: |-
  PLA Blaster Anthracite Grey is a premium filament for 3D printing professionals and enthusiasts who demand technical precision, enhanced mechanical properties, and a sleek industrial look. Built on the proven PLA+ foundation, this filament delivers increased toughness in a deep anthracite-grey matte tone, giving your prints a serious, technical character.
  Thanks to its improved strength and consistent output, PLA Blaster is the go-to choice for projects where functionality and durability matter—without compromising on clean design.
  Key Benefits:

      Improved Strength: PLA Blaster offers higher impact resistance and toughness than standard PLA, making it suitable for prints exposed to light mechanical stress.
      Smooth Printing Experience: Excellent layer adhesion, minimal warping, and easy processing ensure reliable performance even with complex models.
      Wide Compatibility: Works seamlessly with all standard FDM/FFF 3D printers using a 0.4 mm nozzle.
      Eco-Conscious Choice: Made from biodegradable, non-toxic materials—aligned with sustainable printing practices.

  Applications:

      Functional Technical Parts: Housings, brackets, mounts, and more—perfect for technical or practical use.
      Prototypes & Product Design: Ideal for engineers and designers who need a reliable, visually consistent filament.
      Mechanical & Structural Models: Great for printing gears, frames, supports, or functional structures.
      Industrial Accessories: Tools, covers, guards, and working parts for everyday use.
      Neutral Visual Prints: When color should not distract from form or function.

  PLA Blaster Anthracite Grey is the filament of choice for creators who need reliability, precision, and a refined industrial appearance. Perfect for functional projects, technical prototyping, or everyday models that must perform and look sharp.
