  The Future of Sustainable 3D Printing - Made in the USA

  Take your 3D printing to the next level with PHA Biodegradable Filament, the most truly eco-friendly filament on the market. Unlike PLA, which only breaks down in industrial composting conditions, PHA is 6691 Marine Biodegradable, meaning it naturally decomposes in soil and water-without leaving microplastics behind.

  This revolutionary material is sourced from Ecogenesis Biopolymers, a California-based leader in sustainable plastics. The compounding process is done entirely in the USA, ensuring a high-purity, bio-based material that meets the strictest environmental standards. From there, the filament is precision-manufactured in the USA by Polar Filament, guaranteeing top-tier print quality and consistency.
  Why PHA is the Ultimate Eco-Friendly Filament

   6691 Marine Biodegradable - Fully degrades in oceans, rivers, and natural environments, unlike PLA which lingers.
   Sourced and Manufactured in the USA - PHA from Ecogenesis Biopolymers, compounded in the USA, and turned into high-quality filament by Polar Filament.
   Zero Microplastic Pollution - Breaks down into natural elements, making it the most responsible choice for sustainable printing.
   Easy to Print & AMS-Compatible - Designed for smooth extrusion, strong layer adhesion, and effortless use in AMS systems.
