  A Breakthrough in Sustainable 3D Printing

  Our Biodegradable TPU 3D Printer Filament represents a major step forward in eco-friendly 3D printing. Developed in collaboration with Algenesis and Ecogenesis, this plant-based TPU is one of the first of its kind, bringing sustainability to a rapidly growing industry. Marine biodegradable, this filament decomposes in bacteria-rich environments but remains strong and flexible during regular use. Additionally, it is home compostable, offering a responsible end-of-life solution.
  Why Choose Our Biodegradable TPU?

      Pioneering Plant-Based TPU - Developed as part of the first plant-based fused deposition modeling (FDM) filament on the market.

      Marine Biodegradable - Breaks down in bacteria-rich environments, reducing plastic waste without degrading in water alone.

      Home Compostable - Can be composted in a well-maintained home composting system, supporting responsible disposal.

      Premium TPU Performance - Prints just like standard TPU with a Shore Hardness of 95A, offering excellent flexibility, durability, and wear resistance.

      Supports R&D and Prototyping - Enables companies to develop prototypes directly in biodegradable materials, eliminating the need for costly tooling and production methods.

      Addresses 3D Printing Waste - 3D printing generates a significant amount of scrap material; this biodegradable TPU helps reduce environmental impact.

      Available in Multiple Sizes - Choose from 0.5kg and 1kg spools to fit your printing needs.
