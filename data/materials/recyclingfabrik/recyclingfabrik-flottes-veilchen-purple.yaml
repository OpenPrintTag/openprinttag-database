description: |-
  Imagine you are walking through a fragrant garden in which the small violet flowers sway in the wind. The air is filled with a beguiling scent. Suddenly you discover a particularly magnificent violet bed in a corner of the garden. Bees are buzzing and butterflies are sitting on the flowers, enjoying their first food of the year. You also know that violets not only look beautiful with their light purple tone, but can also be used in many different ways. Violets are said to have various healing effects, whether as a mood enhancer, help with colds, soothing for the skin or in an ointment for migraines, and they are also edible. You can design your prints just as diversely with our "Flottes Veilchen" filament. Although not edible or healing, a good print can also be mood-enhancing, right?

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
