description: |-
  Imagine holding a ripe plum in your hand, its velvety, purple skin shimmering in the light. This is exactly the feeling our Shimmering Plum filament brings to your projects. It wraps your creations in the enchanting, rich color of freshly picked plums, refined with a magical silvery shimmer. Ideal for mystical works of art, jewelry and decorations that tell a story of sweet seduction.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
