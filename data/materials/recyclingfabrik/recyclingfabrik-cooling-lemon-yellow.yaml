description: |-
  The sun breaks through the clouds, warming rays lighten your face and your mood. It's afternoon and your hot drink is empty. Do you make yourself another one? Hmm... You go into the kitchen and open the fridge. The perfect drink pops into your head: cool, refreshing and delicious. You make yourself a cooling lemon. Water, ice cubes and of course fresh lemon slices - perfect! Back in the garden, you sit in the sun again and enjoy the warming rays of sunshine while you sip the cooling lemon.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
