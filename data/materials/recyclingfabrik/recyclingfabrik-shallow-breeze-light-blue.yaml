  You've waited a long time, but now it's here! With our "Sparkling Night" filament, you can print the starry sky directly onto your shelf! Deep black meets fine glitter and lets your projects shimmer like a clear December night. Perfect for winter prints or for anything that needs that little something extra.

  "Sparkling Night" consists of the base tone "Good Night" and a glitter component.

  A little note for all those who know our Squeezed Lime from the past: We have slightly adapted the recipes, so the current color may differ slightly from the usual tone of the last few years.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
