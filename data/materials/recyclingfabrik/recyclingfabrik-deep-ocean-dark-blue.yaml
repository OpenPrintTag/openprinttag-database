description: |-
  There is no place on earth that has been less explored than the deep ocean. Human efforts to bring light into the darkness are comparable to a street lamp that is supposed to light up the whole of Sweden. From 200m, not a single photon can penetrate the masses of water and there is eternal darkness. But just before this pitch-black night, there is a place where the last rays of the sun are refracted by the water molecules. This place is the color of our filament. Not black, but not really blue either, and with a hint of green. A color that, upon closer inspection, has an incredible depth.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
