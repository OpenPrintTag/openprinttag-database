description: |-
  The clever little mouse comes out of her house to discover new things. She is intelligent and wants to redesign her house. Inspired by her surroundings, she begins the renovation. She wisely chose a very light gray because it doesn't get dirty as quickly as white and doesn't look as gloomy and threatening as a dark color.

  With the clever mouse you can create impressive models in a light grey splendour. Even though a mouse is quite small, you can create great and big things with the "clever mouse"!


  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
