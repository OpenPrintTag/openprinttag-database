   It's late at night, you're on your way home and the stars are sparkling above you in a deep steel-grey sky. How beautiful would it be to convert this clear darkness into a colour?  

  That's exactly what we did and added a dash of shine to our beloved "Good Night". The result is a "shimmering night" that changes its shine in different lighting conditions. Now it's your turn - turn on the printer and let it shimmer!  

  By the way, the "Shimmering Night" is also available in a bundle with our other winter colors - of course, as always, at a special price.

  Special feature: This shade was created from our black shade "Good Night" - please note, however, that due to the silver color component, this roll can change its color to a dark gray depending on the incidence of light.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
