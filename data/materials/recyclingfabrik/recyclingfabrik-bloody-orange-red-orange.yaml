  You buy a net of oranges in the supermarket and are looking forward to a delicious breakfast juice. When you cut the oranges, red juice runs down the knife, what is that? Bloody oranges! You made a mistake and bought blood oranges, but no problem. Then it will probably be a sour, slightly bitter morning drink. Who buys blood oranges on purpose? We recently had a net of oranges in the office and it seemed like everyone was wondering who buys blood oranges. But hey, tastes differ. What looks good in any case is our "Bloody Orange" as a bright color in the print object!

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
