description: |-
  On a winter walk through snow-covered landscapes and forests, they are constantly in your way - the fir trees. Large and small trees, topped with powdery snow. Here and there it stands out through the white - our shimmering fir green. A beautiful silvery green that fits the season perfectly and belongs in every filament collection. A must for anyone who prefers earthy tones in winter and wants to give their projects that certain something.

  By the way, the "Shimmering Fir" is also available in a bundle with our other winter colors - of course, as always, at a special price.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
