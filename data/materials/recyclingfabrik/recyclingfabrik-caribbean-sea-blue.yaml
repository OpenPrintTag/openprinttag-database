description: |-
  The Caribbean Sea is like a giant cocktail of perfectly blue water, white sandy beaches and a dash of adventure - perfectly mixed and garnished with a colorful garnish of exotic islands. Here the water ripples relaxed and the sun shines so warmly that even the coconuts dance for joy. It's the perfect place to unwind while colorful fish snorkel around your toes. So grab your printer, a roll of "Caribbean Sea", forget the clock and dive into paradise.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PETG!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
