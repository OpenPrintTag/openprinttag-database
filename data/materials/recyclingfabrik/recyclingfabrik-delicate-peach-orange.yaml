description: |-
  The sky is blue, the sun is shining and the sea is rustling gently, a light gust of wind makes the leaves on the peach tree shake. You stretch and pick a ripe fruit. You hold it in your hand and look at it. With its soft skin and delicate orange color, it is perfect. When you bite into it, the juice runs over your hand. The fruity-sweet taste spreads in your mouth. Our "Delicate Peach" filament perfectly captures the light color and sweet scent of this delicious fruit. Did you know that peaches belong to the rose family?


  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
