description: |-
  The last rays of summer sun hit the full lavender field. You are restless because you know that winter is coming ever closer. You take a deep breath and notice how the soapy smell flows into your body. You immediately notice how you become calmer. You pick a small bunch and take it home with you. For a tea or perhaps as a scented spray in the evening to calm down. But do you know that some uses of lavender simply remind you of grandmas?



  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
