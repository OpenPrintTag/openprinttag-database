  Frothy Cappuccino-beige and airy, like the sun shining through morning mist or a freshly brewed coffee to start the day. Now, we've added the perfect beige shade to our rPETG collection! Psst... take a look at the rPETG Basic Bundle-you'll find our essential colors in one package at an unbeatable price!

  The filament is made of 100% recycled rPETG!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
