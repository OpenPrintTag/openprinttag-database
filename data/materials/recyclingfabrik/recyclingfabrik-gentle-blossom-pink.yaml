description: |-
  Small, pink and in full splendor, the gentle blossom grows between the bare gray stones. An unusual location for a flower, but it looks like it belongs there. It has a soft pink color and a small blossom. You look at it for a while and notice that it radiates something calming. You look at it again and go on your way. Whenever you are stressed, you go back to this actually dreary place and look at the gentle blossom.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
