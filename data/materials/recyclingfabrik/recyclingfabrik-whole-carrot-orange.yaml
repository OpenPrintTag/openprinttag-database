  Carrots, also known as carrots, are true jewels of nature that sprout from the earth like bright rays of sunshine. Their deep orange skin looks amazingly similar to our new PETG filament "Full Carrot", so there must be some kind of relationship! When you break a carrot, a fresh, sweet scent emerges that reminds you of warm summer days and blooming gardens. This is exactly the feeling you get when your printer feeds in a fresh roll of our filament. Just give it a try!

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
