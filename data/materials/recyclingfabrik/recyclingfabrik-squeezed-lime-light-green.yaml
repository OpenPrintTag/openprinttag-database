description: |-
  In the small town of Zitronenbach lived a talented mixologist named Max. He was known for his refreshing cocktails, which he prepared with great dedication. One day he was visited by a mysterious old woman who gave him a squeezed lime, which supposedly had magical powers. Curious, Max tried the lime and couldn't believe it when he noticed that his cocktails changed taste after every sip. From sweet to sour, from fruity to tart. The lime gave his drink an amazing variety of flavors. Max experimented with different combinations and created unique creations.

  A little note for all those who know our Squeezed Lime from the past: We have slightly adapted the recipes, so the current color may differ slightly from the usual tone of the last few years.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
