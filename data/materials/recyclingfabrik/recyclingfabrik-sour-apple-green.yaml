  Sour Apple Rings: the rollercoaster of the candy world! Imagine biting into an apple that has decided to trade its normal fruit life for a life of adventure. At first you'll be hit by a wave of sour intensity - but don't worry, after this wild ride you'll slide gently into the sweet embrace of sugar, like a safe harbor after a storm. You're probably already on your way to the supermarket to get a bag from the candy aisle, but we have a better idea! Our fresh PETG filament: Sour Apple.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
