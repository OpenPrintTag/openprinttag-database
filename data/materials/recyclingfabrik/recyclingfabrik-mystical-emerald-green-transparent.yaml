  Have you always wanted to dig up a rare, hidden gemstone from the earth? That would be an amazing experience-but there's an easier way! This green-transparent, 100% recycled PETG filament enchants you like an emerald-mystical and fascinating in its purity, yet much easier to obtain. Some might say it bears a resemblance to green recycled glass...

  The filament is made of 100% recycled rPETG!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
