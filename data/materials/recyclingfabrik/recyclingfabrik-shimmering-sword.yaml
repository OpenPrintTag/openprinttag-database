description: |-
  Have you ever dreamed of forging a sword so bright that even unicorns would turn green with envy? Well, with our Shimmering Sword filament you can do just that - and you don't have to spend hours slaving away over a hot fire! Create shiny creations that refract light and turn your prints into true works of art. This silver tone, like all of our shimmering filaments, changes color depending on the light. With our Shimmering Sword you won't be able to defeat dragons or banish demons, but you can certainly show your neighbor who the true ruler of the 3D printing kingdom is!

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
