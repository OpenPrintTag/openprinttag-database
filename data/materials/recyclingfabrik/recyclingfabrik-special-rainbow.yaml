  Imagine being able to go from a relaxed lavender-violet to a vibrant orange in a single print, with a smooth transition. Or simply from a dark steel grey to a lighter grey, like our "Smart Mouse" - that's exactly what our new Rainbow filament makes possible.  

  These are the rare spools that are created when a color changes during production. This means that well over 100 different color combinations see the light of day and we leave it entirely to chance which one you get ! Of course, it's not just the look that's special - this filament still offers our usual top print quality and is as sturdy as your grandma's favorite coffee mug.  

  Special feature: You are guaranteed to get an exciting color transition with this roll of filament. The product photos are intended to illustrate the color transition. The color combination of your roll can and probably will differ - but it is certainly no less cool.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
