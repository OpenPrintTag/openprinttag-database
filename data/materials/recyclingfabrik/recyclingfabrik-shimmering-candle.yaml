  Most people will know this cozy and sheltered feeling when the cold season arrives and more and more candles appear in the windows of the houses. There is flickering everywhere and the autumn decorations give way to white stars and red candles. Immerse yourself in this winter magic with our "Shimmering Candle" filament. The red with its silver shimmer gives your prints the warm glow of a candle and is perfect for all festive creations and a cozy atmosphere - simply winter wonderful!

  By the way, the "Shimmering Candle" is also available in a bundle with our other winter colors - of course, as always, at a special price.

  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
