description: |-
  What a perfect day for a walk. You walk straight ahead through the busy streets - out of the city - and suddenly you can breathe much easier. The birds are chirping and you notice a new, pleasant smell. You look around and discover where it comes from: the meadows around you have been freshly mown and the slightly flowery, grassy scent of fresh meadows is in the air. Even a few storks land on the meadows, because they too are attracted by the wonderful smell. Who doesn't know it?


  The filament is made of 100% recycled PLA!

  All the filaments we sell are made from a mixture of industrial waste and returns from all of you. Since the color compositions of the leftovers change every time, no batch of our different colors will be identical . Therefore, every object printed with our filament is absolutely unique.
  In addition, our quality control ensures that you only get high-quality filament. Before we release a batch for sale, we test it extensively. Although we carefully sort, wash, process and filter the submissions during extrusion, tiny particles can be trapped in the filament. However, these are harmless for printing and the printer.

   The filament has a diameter of 1.75mm  0.05mm.

  * This coil is not necessarily compatible with the Bambu Lab AMS system.

  * Do you need AMS compatibility? Feel free to use our refill as soon as it is available.
