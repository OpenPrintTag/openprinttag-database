  Manufacture picture perfect parts at an unbeatable price with Matte Recycled PETG. Matte RPETG reduces the environmental impact of additive manufacturing by turning waste plastic into source material.

  Matte Recycled PETG by IC3D is made from PETG resin sourced from both industrial and commercial operations and is the preferred material within our in-house 3D print services department. Each production run of Recycled PETG starts with 100% recycled content to maintain consistent 3D printing performance. All R-PETG filament is reeled onto reused spools when available. Learn more: IC3D Spool Return System.

  Matte Recycled PETG must be stored in a dry location. Active drying before use is recommended. We are proud to manufacture this product from post-industrial and post-commercial waste. Recycled material may exhibit some variance in thermal and mechanical properties. Please refer to the printing recommendations in/on the box as we continue to work toward making recycled materials a sustainable option for our industry.
