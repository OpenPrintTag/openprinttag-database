description: |
  This nylon is exceptionally stiff & strong and EASY to print with little to no warpage.
  Prints exceptionally well with warm (60C) glass coated with PVA or Magigoo. Each roll includes a reusable moisture indicator card.
  Engineering grade alloyed PA Copolymer resin, adhesion promoters , impact modifiers & USA made premium MILLED carbon fiber NOT powder or dust. 
  Filament and parts are NOT overly brittle like some other CF products. Excellent for professional looking & strong technical prints. 
  ****This product is intended to be printed by EXPERIENCED NYLON users with the capability to store and handle nylon filaments while keeping them DRY / being able to DRY them when needed. This product must be stored properly and kept dry BEFORE AND DURING PRINTING, moisture will result in weak/failed prints and not valid for warranty claims.**** 
  **PRODUCT IS SHIPPED DRY AND READY TO USE WITH A REUSABLE MOISTURE INDICATING CARD**

  Carbon fiber infused filament benefits:

      Massive increase to rigidity / strength
      Highly desirable texture / look
      Greatly reduced part shrink / warp
      Greatly reduced stringing / angel hairs
      Printed parts hold better details / sharp corners
