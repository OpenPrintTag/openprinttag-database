  Welcome to HATCHBOX 3D Products! Our engineered filament is here to help you stream your creative outlet, enabling you to see your thoughts and concepts engineered into a real and rewarding reality. The filaments are universally designed and compatible with 3D Printers using 1.75mm diameter filament, with a dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.03mm. ABS or Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, is a tough and durable thermoplastic. It's ability to with stand higher temperatures, ABS is one of the most popular and commonly chosen material on the market. ABS can be used for full functional models, and is the closest material to real production models. The 3D printed object will have a glossy type finish. 

  Why we love it: Prints at higher temperature / Tough / Durable / Requires less manual finishing / Process in acetone for polished finished
