  Welcome to HATCHBOX 3D Products! Our engineered filament is here to help you stream your creative outlet, enabling you to see your thoughts and concepts engineered into a real and rewarding reality. The filaments are universally designed and compatible with 3D printers using 1.75mm diameter filaments, with a dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.03mm. HATCHBOX TPU filament is reshaping the industry with this elastic filament designed for more specialized prints - the possibilities really are endless! TPU, or Thermoplastic Polyurethane, has many every day uses due to its soft and malleable characteristics when heated, and its hardness and structural integrity when cooled. TPU is popular in almost every industry from medical instruments, automotive parts, sporting goods, and even protective cases for electronic devices. What do Shore and the Shore Measurement of 95A mean? Shore is one method of measuring hardness. On a Shore hardness scale, TPU's can be categorized into A (flexible type) and D (rigid type). On both A and D scales, the range is from 0 (soft) to 100 (hard). Therefore, HATCHBOX's Shore 95A grade denotes it to be a hard, highly resilient, and reliable material.

  Why we love it: Less warping / Easy to use / No heated bed required / Nature-friendly.
