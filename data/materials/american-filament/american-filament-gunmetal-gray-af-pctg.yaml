description: |-
  American Filament PCTG is very similar to PETG with several distinct advantages. You could even call it a PETG+! Our PCTG is made with a PET-based copolyester specifically designed for professional grade 3D printing applications where easy processing and high toughness are critical. 

  Our PCTG is made with a PET-based copolyester specifically designed for professional grade 3D printing applications where easy processing and high toughness are critical.

  This material features a unique self-bonding ability providing very high layer-to-layer adhesion; possesses a high melt strength ensuring an even flow during the 3D printing process; is more chemically resistant & stable than PETG, ABS, or ASA (making it suitable for a wide variety of applications); boasts unmatched impact strength & toughness; has lower moisture absorption than PETG (making it more shelf stable); and can be printed reliably without an enclosure. 

  Unlike PETG, the finish of PCTG can vary between matte and glossy depending upon the temperature and speed settings you choose. Try 240-245degreesC to get that matte finish!
