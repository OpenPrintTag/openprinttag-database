      [Strong toughness without breakage]Compared to other PLA filaments 1.75mm, Official Creality Ender-PLA+ improves filament toughness. It can be folded repeatedly with less risk of breaking, and the firm model is firmer and not easy to damage.

      High quality and easy to print: no clogging, no bubbles, no tangles, smooth printing. Designed and manufactured with anti-clog patent to ensure a smooth and stable printing experience. The good fluidity allows the PLA+ filament bundle to be extruded evenly and smoothly during printing. No clogging of the nozzle and improved printing success rate.

      [Accuracy & Consistency]This PLA Plus 1.75 mm diameter, a spool of 1kg (1kg), minimum dimensional tolerance  0.03 mm. It has wide compatibility, making it suitable for almost 1.75mm FDM 3D printers due to the small diameter error.

      [Environmentally friendly materials]Made from environmentally friendly materials, the filament of 3D printers has no smell, pollution and toxicity when printing.

      [Vacuum Sealed with Desiccant]Prevents moisture absorption, allowing detailed resolution for more printing scenarios, such as educational toys, machine parts, home accessories and functional parts, etc.
