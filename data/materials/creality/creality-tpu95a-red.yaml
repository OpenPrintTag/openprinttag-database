      Higher Resilience & Hardness: Soft Adhesive Material, boasting a 95A hardness, filament tpu combines high resilience, exceptional glossiness, and elasticity for optimal results. Harder and easier to print than standard TPU, it delivers precise, durable outputs with minimal warping

      High Wear Resistance & Aging Resistance: The printing model is resistant to wear and scratch, with good aging resistance. waterproof and moisture proof, keep warm and defend cold. UV resistance

      Good Chemical Performance: Excellent chemical resistance (water resistance, oil resistance, solvent resistance) and environmental protection, and nontoxic

      Compatible Models CR-TPU is wildly used in FDM 3D printers on the market. The filament is also very easy to work with and fits most FDM printers

      Creality Support: Creality provides 12-month & 24 hours after-sales service. NotePlease place this product in a dry and ventilated environment, not in an environment of high temperature, sunny or humid conditions.
