      [Strong Toughness without Breakage]Compare with other PLA filament, the Creality Ender PLA+ filament enhances the toughness of the filament. It can be repeated bending with less susceptible to breakage, and the firm model is firmer and not easy to damage

      [High-quality & Easy to Print]No clogging, no bubbling, no knotting, smooth printing! Designed and Manufactured with Clog-Free patent to guarantee a smooth and stable printing experience. The good fluidity enables PLA+ filament bundle to be extruded evenly and smoothly during printing. No clogging to the nozzle, and improving the printing success rate

      [Dimensional Accuracy & Consistency]The PLA Plus filament, 1 kg spool (2.2lbs), of 1.75mm diameter, Minimum dimensional tolerance 0.02mm. It has wide compatibility making it suitable for almost 1.75mm FDM 3D printers due to the small diameter error

      [High Compatibility & Environmental Material]Ender PLA+ filament perfectly compatible with Creality 3D printers Ender series, CR series, Fully-Enclosed series and compatible with 99% FDM Printers in the market. Made from environmentally friendly materials, the 3D printers filament does not have odor, pollution and toxic during the printing

      [Vacuum-sealed with Desiccant]Creality plafilament 1.75mm, preventing moisture absorption, allowing for high-detail resolution for more printing scenarios, such as educational toys, machine parts, home accessories and functional parts etc
