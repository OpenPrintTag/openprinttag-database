      [Strong Toughness without Breakage]Compare with other 1.75 PLA filament, the Official Creality Ender-PLA+ enhances the toughness of the filament. It can be repeated bending with less susceptible to breakage, and the firm model is firmer and not easy to damage. The 3D filament is suitable for 99% the needs of DIY enthusiasts

      [High-quality and Easy to Print]No clogging, no bubbling, no knotting, smooth printing! Designed and Manufactured with Clog-Free patent to guarantee a smooth and stable printing experience. The good fluidity enables PLA+ filament bundle to be extruded evenly and smoothly during printing. No clogging to the nozzle, and improving the printing success rate

      [Accuracy & Consistency]The PLA Plus, 1 kg spool (2.2lbs), of 1.75mm diameter, Minimum dimensional tolerance 0.02mm. It has wide compatibility making it suitable for almost 1.75mm FDM 3D printers due to the small diameter error

      [Environmentally Friendly Materials]Made from environmentally friendly materials, the 3D printers filament does not have odor, pollution and toxic during the printing

      [Vacuum-sealed with Desiccant]Preventing moisture absorption, allowing for high-detail resolution for more printing scenarios, such as educational toys, machine parts, home accessories and functional parts etc
