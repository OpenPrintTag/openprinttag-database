description: |-
  Prusament PETG Tungsten 75% is a highly specialized filament designed mainly for radiation shielding purposes. Tungsten (also known as wolfram) powder inside the PETG filament is a heavy metal that does not react with water and is resistant to oxidation at room temperature. Unlike lead, tungsten is hypoallergenic and non-toxic. This makes it perfectly suitable for creating complex X-ray and gamma-ray radiation-shielding components (not only for medical applications) in an easier and faster way compared to conventional methods.

  Find out more about Prusament PETG Tungsten 75% and its uses in the announcement article.

  - Print preparation

  It is necessary to use a hardened steel nozzle. Tungsten powder is a highly abrasive material and may damage a brass nozzle.

  Powder-coated Satin or TXT sheet provides good adhesion. Clean it with IPA (available in drugstores, for example) which works great not only with Prusament PETG Tungsten 75% but with other materials too.

  Pour a small amount of IPA on a paper towel and use it for cleaning the surface. To achieve the best results, clean the surface while it's cold. Keep in mind that higher temperatures will evaporate the alcohol before cleaning the surface. Also, don't forget that the heatbed preheated for printing Prusament PETG Tungsten 75% has a high temperature (80 °C) and may burn you if you touch it! Another possibility is cleaning the surface with warm water and a few drops of dish cleaner on a paper towel. You can also use denatured alcohol.

  We don't recommend printing with Prusament PETG Tungsten 75% on a smooth PEI sheet. This material adheres greatly to the PEI surface and may cause damage to it. This type of damage is not covered by the warranty. If you need to print on a smooth surface, spread a thin layer of paper glue stick on it.
