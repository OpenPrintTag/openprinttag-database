description: |-
  PLA is the easiest material to print. It is inexpensive and suitable for beginners and advanced users alike. It is capable of printing detailed models, figures, and quick prototypes that don’t require increased mechanical, chemical, or temperature resistance.

  PLA is the most widely used filament, known for its great looks and ease of printing. It is an excellent choice for large objects because of its low thermal expansion, which results in minimal warping. At the same time, its low melting temperature makes it suitable for small parts as well.

  While PLA may not be as tough or durable as some advanced materials, its versatility makes it ideal for a range of applications, including large objects, miniatures, concept models, and prototypes that don’t need to be extremely durable.
