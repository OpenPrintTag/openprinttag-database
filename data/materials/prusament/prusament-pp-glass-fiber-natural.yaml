description: |-
  Polypropylene (PP) is a lightweight material with exceptional heat and chemical resistance. The glass fibers inside the filament give it great dimensional stability, which means little to no warping during the printing. On the other hand, the glass fibers are highly abrasive, and a hardened nozzle is a must. The PP Glass Fiber offers high mechanical resistance, plus it can be colored, as the base material’s color is translucent white. The material is easy to print and the surface has an attractive, rough matte finish. Note that the Prusament PP Glass Fiber is not ideal for printing tiny details and requires a hardened nozzle.

  We do not guarantee a perfect winding for this type of filament.

  Due to its lightweight properties and extreme heat and chemical resistance, the Prusament PP Glass Fiber is suitable for demanding applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. It can serve its purpose in laboratories for custom equipment, such as vial racks. Hobbyists may find this filament useful for printing drone parts and other components that require outstanding mechanical properties.
