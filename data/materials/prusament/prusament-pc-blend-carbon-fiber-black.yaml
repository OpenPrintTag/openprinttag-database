  Prusament PC Blend Carbon Fiber (PCCF) is our own in-house made filament filled with carbon fibers. The whole manufacturing process is closely monitored and tested - we guarantee ±0.04 mm precision and highly-consistent colors.

  You can inspect the parameters of every spool we made at prusament.com.

  - About PC Blend Carbon Fiber

  Prusament PC Blend Carbon Fiber (PCCF) is a PC Blend filled with carbon fibers to improve its strength, toughness, and temperature resistance. Unlike the unmodified PC Blend, PCCF comes with great dimensional stability, good resistance to UV light and common chemicals, better tensile strength, but most importantly with high-temperature resistance and easier printing. It is optimal for printing technical components requiring great strength and high-temperature tolerance. The possibility of printing large models without using an enclosure is a great advantage when compared to pure PC Blend. Printing with PCCF requires a hardened steel nozzle.

  - Print preparation

  It is necessary to use a hardened steel nozzle. Carbon fibers are a highly abrasive material and may damage a brass nozzle.
  Powder-coated or satin TXT sheet provides good adhesion. Clean it with IPA (available in drugstores, for example) which works great not only with PCCF but with other materials too.

  Pour a small amount of IPA on a paper towel and use it for cleaning the surface. To achieve the best results, clean the surface while it's cold. Keep in mind that higher temperatures will evaporate the alcohol before cleaning the surface. Also, don't forget that the heatbed preheated for printing with PCCF has a high temperature (110 °C) and may burn you if you touch it! Another possibility is cleaning the surface with warm water and a few drops of dish cleaner on a paper towel. You can also use denatured alcohol.

  We don't recommend printing with PCCF on a smooth PEI sheet. This material adheres greatly to the PEI surface and may cause damage to it. This type of damage is not covered by the warranty. If you need to print on a smooth surface, spread a thin layer of paper glue stick on it.

  Also, if you often print with PCCF on the satin sheet, we recommend using a glue stick to prevent surface wear-out.
