description: |-
  Prusament PETG Recycled is our own in-house made filament with ±0.05mm manufacturing tolerance. 100 % of the material consists of recycled Prusament PETG materials, so every batch has a different color. You can inspect the parameters of every spool we made at prusament.com.

  Prusament PETG Recycled is our own in-house filament. 100% of the material consists of shredded Prusament PETG filaments that didn't pass our strict control, so every batch has a different color. Due to its excellent layer-to-layer adhesion, PETG prints are ideal for indoor and outdoor waterproof applications. Furthermore, PETG is a tough material with good high-temperature resistance. The G in the acronym stands for a glycol-modified substance that is present during the manufacturing process. It modifies the properties of PET, so that it's easier to print, less brittle, and clearer when printing with semi-transparent variants. PETG has a low thermal expansion, so even when printing big objects, and without an enclosure, it rarely lifts from the bed and warps. In addition to that, PETG has a healthy amount of flex which can prevent parts from breaking under pressure. We use PETG to print parts for our printers!
