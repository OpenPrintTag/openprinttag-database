       ZYLtech PLA is an affordable PLA filament formulated to highlight the best attributes of the material: quality, reliability and ease to print. ZYLtech PLA comes in a wide choice of bold colors to select from. 

  NOW we have more and more PLA filament colors being made at our facility in Houston, Texas

  All made in USA filaments are clearly marked with "made in the USA" banner in our product page and also have "made in the USA" sticker on the box.

  We use virgin Natureworks resin with each spool traceable to specific batch came directly from Natureworks Nebraska plant to our Houston facility.

  Our made in the USA PLA filament features 0.02mm tolerance and improved winding. As our current imported stock is being phased out, we will update other colors to be made in the USA.

  ZYLtech PLA filaments have taken the best aspects of PLA filament, including renewability, biodegradability, and adaptability. PLA, known as Polylactic Acid, is the most widely used plastic filament in 3D printing. PLA filament is a bioplastic due to the fact that it is produced from renewable natural resources such as tapioca and corn starch products. As a biodegradable material, so it is much better for the environment in contrast to petrochemical-based alternatives.
