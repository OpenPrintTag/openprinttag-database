  Acrylonitrile Butadiene Stirene. It is one of the most used thermoplastics in 3D printing. Its main characteristics: very tough, hard and rigid material, with chemical resistance to abrasion. It is soluble in acetone. It is not biodegradable, and it suffers from UV exposure. It requires a hot bed between 80C and 100C. As a curiosity, the LEGO pieces are made with ABS.

  *In the transition phase to ECO-packaging (reel and cardboard box)
  Do you know...?

  ABS is soluble in acetone? This can be really interesting if you want your pieces to have excellent and bright surface nishes. If so, try doing what is called an acetone vapor bath, always with extremely care because acetone is a toxic chemical.

  Here we share with you a video where it is showed how to do easily this process and the final results obtained: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv-CbnB8Uz4

  What can you achieve with this material?

  Resistant printings with good mechanical properties. Our ABS filament has low warping to let you print with this material easier. Print your designs in many super colours!
