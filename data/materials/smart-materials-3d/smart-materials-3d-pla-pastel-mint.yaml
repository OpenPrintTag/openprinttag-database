  ALL OF OUR SMARTFIL PLA CARRIES THE HIGH-SPEED SEAL, compatible with high-speed printers.

  Filament for 3D printing in pastel colors.

  *In the transition phase to ECO-packaging (reel and cardboard box)

  Filament for 3D printing in pastel colors

  The filament PLA is a biodegradable plastic due to its natural origin (corn, sugarcane or potatoes). In addition, it is one of the most easy to print materials in the 3D printing world.

  What can you achieve with this material?

  Print easily a lot of models with higher printing speed than other materials. You will not have pieces with warping as this material does not have contractions, so you will be able to print with high resolution models with a good surface finish. Print your designs in many superb colours!
