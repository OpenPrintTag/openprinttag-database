description: |
  ASA is a filament for 3d printing with exceptional weather resistance. Unlike many plastic materials, the ASA maintains its color and impact resistance, even after long-term outdoor use.

  It is mechanically robust, perfect for applications with need of resistance. Resistant to ultraviolet rays (U.V.), therefore does not  goes yellow. Water resistant. It has great dimensional stability, so it does not present warping and the printing pieces have good tolerances.

  APLICATIONS

      Prototyping of parts that require resistance to UV rays
      Decoration objects and figures for outdoors
      Automotive industry
      Signage
      Industrial applications that require mechanical resistance
      Water and weather resistant parts
      Electrical installations

  POSTPROCESING

  The materials molded in ASA allow a post-processing

      Machining: turning, milling, drilling, saw cutting
      Soldier: hot plate, by rotation and in some cases by ultrasound
      Bonding: ASA is soluble in methyl ethyl ketone, dichloroethylene and cyclohexanone
      Surface treatment (printing, painting without special pre-treatment)
