  Our SMARTFIL(R) R-PET is 100% recycled, keeping all the qualities of PET but created by recovering raw material, we have created a product that supports the circular economy in addition to having excellent protection against UV radiation and humidity. It stands out for its high adhesion between layers and also a high printing definition.

  RPET is a material made with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from recycled sources, the letter R designates the origin of the raw material which is recovered from the containers made of PET and subsequently have been subjected to a recycling process for its reuse, the content of recycled material is 100% so it is a product that promotes the circular economy and makes more efficient and less polluting use of plastic products.

  The use of PET is widely used in different sectors, food, cosmetics, pharmacy and they are mainly intended for the manufacture of containers or blisters to protect different items and foods, most beverage bottles are made of PET.

  It stands out for its following characteristics:

  * Excellent protection against CO2, O2 gases.

  * Excellent protection against UV radiation and humidity.

  * It is waterproof, very resistant.

  * It is totally recyclable.

  * High adhesion between layers.
