  ALL OF OUR RECYCLED PLA CARRIES THE HIGH-SPEED SEAL, compatible with high-speed printers.

  100% recycled and biodegradable PLA filament in new recyclable packaging. We create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly set, without the filament losing properties and quality in printing, at an excellent price.

  100% recycled and biodegradable PLA filament. New packaging with recyclable cardboard box and reel. We create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly set, without the filament losing properties and quality in printing

  Properties:

  * 100% recycled

  * 100% recyclable cardboard packaging

  * Biodegradable

  * Excellent mechanical properties and high quality in 3D printing

  Comparison with virgin PLA:

  * Greater mechanical resistance

  * Greater printing temperature range 190C-220C

  * Greater fluidity

  How do we get the recycled material?

  In Smart Materials 3d. material waste is produced during the manufacturing process. In our desire to achieve a more sustainable company, we treat this waste by turning it into filament, which, without losing its quality, is a more ecological option thanks to the elimination of waste.
