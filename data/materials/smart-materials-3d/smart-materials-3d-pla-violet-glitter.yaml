  ALL OF OUR SMARTFIL PLA CARRIES THE HIGH-SPEED SEAL, compatible with high-speed printers.

  The filament PLA is a biodegradable plastic due to its natural origin (corn, sugarcane or potatoes) with glitter particles. In addition, it is one of the most easy to print.

  *In the transition phase to ECO-packaging (reel and cardboard box)

  Did you know...?
  That PLA let you get 2 surface finishes? If the filament is extruded at a temperature lower than 225C, you'll achieve a Gloss finish, but if the temperature is over 225-230C you'll get a Matt finish.

  What can you achieve with this material?

  Print easily a lot of models with higher printing speed than other materials. You will not have pieces with warping as this material does not have contractions, so you will be able to print with high resolution models with a good surface finish.
  Print your designs in many superb colours!
