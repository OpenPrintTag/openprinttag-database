description: |
  Is quite resistant but it has certain flexibility. It is ideal for traslucent pieces. It has a strong resistance to chemicals too.

  *In the transition phase to ECO-packaging (reel and cardboard box)

  Smartfil PETG is a thermoplastic copolyester that unlike PET, it doesn't cristallyze when it is heated up, so it is a resistant material with certain flexibility. Besides, it has great chemical resistance and transparency.

  This filament has the USP class VI or ISO 10993-1 certification, with this certification it guarantees that this filament is biocompatible with the human body. (Only available in natural color)
