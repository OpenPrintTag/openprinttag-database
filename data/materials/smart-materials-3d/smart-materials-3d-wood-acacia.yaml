description: |-


  Premium quality biodegradable and compostable 3D printing filament, obtained from a polymeric matrix and a 40% load from organic matter such as wood.

  Wood is a high-quality filament; It has a high wood load combined with a variety of pigments to simulate the appearance and the feel of real wood.

  Pieces printed with Smartfil Wood have a spectacular result, as they appear to be made with real wood, because this filament is made of 40% of organic matter, such as wood. During the process of printing, the same piece, the colour tone can vary if temperature is changed. 

  It is easy to print with the possibility of machining to improve the surface finish.
