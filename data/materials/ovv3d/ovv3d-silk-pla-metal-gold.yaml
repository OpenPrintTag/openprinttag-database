      [Upgrade Silk PLA Filament]Because of the latest patented material, silk pla sky blue is more smooth and shiny than ever. What you 3d printing out will be as glossy as in the pictures, no exaggeration. We specialize in silk PLA filament and bring the best 3D printing creative experience.

      [Perfect Winding] Using the latest intelligent winding machine and strict manual inspection procedures to ensure that each roll of PLA filament is neat and tidy. We pay attention to every detail of our products to provide high quality 3D printer filament.

      [Easy to Print]The diameter tolerance of this 1.75 PLA filament is +/- 0.02mm. More stable diameter tolerance of 3D printer filament would give you smoother 3D printing. High toughness PLA filament 1.75mm cause you have room for 3D printing imagination.

      [PLA Raw Material]The raw material comes from Europe, and it has been developed and modulated to show a charming gloss on the PLA. No jamming, no bubble, no tangle, and no layer line, just silk PLA filament.

      [ECO Packaging]Instead of plastic spools, we use paper spool and paper box to package PLA filament. Protecting the environment is the responsibility of each of us. The PLA filament is vacuum packed with high quality desiccant to keep dry.
