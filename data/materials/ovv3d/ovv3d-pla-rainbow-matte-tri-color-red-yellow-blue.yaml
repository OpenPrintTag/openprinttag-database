      [Tri-Colors Coextruded Filament]Different from normal color change rainbow PLA filament, every inch of this magic 3d filament is made of three colors-Red Blue and Yellow. Therefore, you will easily get all colors, even for very small prints. Different prints will present different effects. Enjoy your 3d printing creations.

      [Dream Like Macaron PLA+] OVV3D Matte Rainbow PLA Filament consists of Pink, Yellow and Sky Blue, which blend in nicely. You will love the purity and dream like quality that it creates.

      [Easy to Print]The diameter tolerance of this 1.75 PLA filament is +/- 0.02mm. More stable diameter tolerance of 3D printer filament would give you smoother 3D printing. High toughness PLA filament 1.75mm cause you have room for 3D printing imagination.

      [PLA Plus Raw Material] The raw material comes from Europe, and it has been developed and modulated to show a outstanding print quality on the PLA. No jamming, no bubble, no tangle, and no layer line, just perfect rainbow PLA filament.

      [ECO Packaging]Instead of plastic spools, we use paper spool and paper box to package PLA filament. Protecting the environment is the responsibility of each of us. The PLA filament is vacuum packed with high quality desiccant to keep dry.
