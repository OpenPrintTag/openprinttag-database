      [Dual Color PLA Filament]Different from normal color change rainbow PLA filament, every inch of this magic 3d filament is made of 2 colors-Blue and Green. Therefore, you will easily get all colors, even for very small prints. Different prints will present different effects. Enjoy your 3d printing creations.

      [Silk PLA Filament]We specialize in silk PLA filament so that the surface of this dual color 3d printing filament is also very smooth and shiny. What you 3d printing out will be as glossy as in the pictures, no exaggeration.

      [Easy to Print]The diameter tolerance of this 1.75 PLA filament is +/- 0.02mm. More stable diameter tolerance of 3D printer filament would give you smoother 3D printing. High toughness PLA filament 1.75mm cause you have room for 3D printing imagination.

      [Upgrade PLA Raw Material]The raw material comes from Europe, and it has been developed and modulated to show a charming gloss on the PLA. No jamming, no bubble, no tangle, and no layer line, just silk color changing PLA filament.

      [ECO Packaging]Instead of plastic spools, we use paper spool and paper box to package PLA filament. Protecting the environment is the responsibility of each of us. The PLA filament is vacuum packed with high quality desiccant to keep dry.
