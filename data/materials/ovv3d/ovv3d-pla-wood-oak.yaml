      [WALNUT WOOD PLA+]OVV3D walnut wood PLA filament add more than 30% real wood fiber, which makes the printed models look like real woodwork. This wood PLA shows a dark brown or chocolate brown color, has the grainy appearance of woodwork and even smells like wood.

      [EASY TO PRINT]The diameter tolerance of this 1.75 PLA filament is +/- 0.03mm. More stable diameter tolerance of 3D printer filament would give you smoother 3D printing experience. High toughness PLA filament 1.75mm cause you have room for 3D printing imagination.

      [PLA PLUS RAW MATERIAL]The raw material comes from Europe, and it has been developed and modulated to show a outstanding print quality on the PLA. No jamming, no bubble, no tangle, and no layer line, just perfect wood PLA filament.

      [PERFECT WINDING] Using the latest intelligent winding machine and strict manual inspection procedures to ensure that each roll of PLA filament is neat and tidy. We pay attention to every detail of our 3D printer filament to provide high quality 3D printing.

      [ECO Packaging]Instead of plastic spools, we use paper spool and paper box to package PLA filament. Protecting the environment is the responsibility of each of us. The PLA filament is vacuum packed with high quality desiccant to keep dry.
