      [5 COLORS SILK RAINBOW PLA+] OVV3D Silk Rainbow PLA Filament consists of Purple Pink Yellow Green Blue, which blend in nicely. You will love the purity and dream like quality that it creates.

      [FAST COLOR CHANGING] This Rainbow PLA filament is color changing every 10 meter--very fast color change. And the color transition of this rainbow filament i
      [Silk PLA Filament]We specialize in silk PLA filament so that the surface of this rainbow 3D printing filament is very smooth and shiny. What you 3D printing out will be as glossy as in the pictures, no exaggeration.

      [EASY TO PRINT] The diameter tolerance of this 1.75 PLA filament is +/- 0.03mm. More stable diameter tolerance of 3D printer filament would give you smoother 3D printing experience. High toughness PLA filament 1.75mm cause you have room for 3D printing imagination.

      [PLA PLUS RAW MATERIAL] The raw material comes from Europe, and it has been developed and modulated to show a outstanding print quality on the PLA. No jamming, no bubble, no tangle, and no layer line, just perfect rainbow PLA filament.

      [PERFECT WINDING] Using the latest intelligent winding machine and strict manual inspection procedures to ensure that each roll of PLA filament is neat and tidy. We pay attention to every detail of our 3D printer filament to provide high quality 3D printing.

      [ECO Packaging] Instead of plastic spools, we use paper spool and paper box to package PLA filament. Protecting the environment is the responsibility of each of us. The PLA filament is vacuum packed with high quality desiccant to keep dry.

      [ORIGINAL VISION & VALUE] OVV3D inspired by those with a passion for 3D printing, aim to share passions, energy and happiness with every 3D printing lovers in the world, exploring infinite possibilities of creativity and imagination.
