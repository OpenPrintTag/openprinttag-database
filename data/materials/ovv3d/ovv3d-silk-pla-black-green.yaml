      AMAZING PRINT EFFECT - The PLA filament is color change dual colors - black, Blue, and a little purple as a transition color. You would get a complete discoloration when you print a 120g object. The reason why this 3D printer filament looks beautiful is the wonderful silk PLA filament surface.

      EASY TO PRINT - The diameter tolerance of this 1.75 PLA filament is +/- 0.02mm. More stable diameter tolerance of 3D printer filament would give you smoother 3D printing. High toughness PLA filament cause you have room for 3D printing imagination.

      UPGRADE PLA RAW MATERIAL - The raw material comes from Europe, and it has been developed and modulated to show a charming sparkle on the PLA. No jamming, no bubble, no tangle, and no layer line, just silk color changing PLA filament.

      ECO PACKAGING - Instead of plastic spools, we use paper spools to package PLA filament. Protecting the environment is the responsibility of each of us. You could put back the PLA filament into the reusable bag to keep dry which has a sealing strip and a high-quality desiccant.

      STL DESIGNER - Skull from myminifactory @ArsMoriendi3D, thanks a lot for wonderful object! Enjoy your 3D printing and please feel free to contact us when you get any problems.
