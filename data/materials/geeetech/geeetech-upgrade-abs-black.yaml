      [Strong 3D Printing Filament ABS]Geeetech ABS 1.75mm is an enhanced version of Ordinary ABS, cracking and warping have been significantly improved when printing big items. It has high strength, better toughness, excellent impact strength, wear resistance, and heat resistance

      [High Compatibility]Strong and durable filament abs is engineering thermoplastic. Geeetech ABS is made from durable thermoplastic and is utilized for prints that are frequently handled, dropped, or in may be stored in high temperatures such as phone cases, sport camera mounts, toys, tools, electrical enclosures etc

      [Less Cracking & Low Odor & Warping]3d printer filament abs delivers excellent printing quality with minimal odor and low warpage during printing. Complete drying for 12 hours before vacuum packaging. An enclosed chamber is required for better printing quality and durability when printing big parts with ABS filaments

      [Technology Upgrade Easy Printing]Compared with other brands of ABS, Geeetech 1.75 ABS filament uses new technology printing large objects with edges and corners, layer separation, warping, splitting and different phenomena are improved, the solution has good fluidity, and the printing is smooth

      [ABS Filament Recommended Printer Settings ]Geeetech ABS Filament Compatible with Most of FDM 3D printers that can use a 1.75 mm 3D printer filament. Nozzle print temperature: 220C - 250C; Bed temperture: 90C - 110C; Speed: 20mm/s - 150mm/s
