      [High Hardness and Strength ]Compared with basic PLA,Carbon fiber filament has the characteristics of high stiffness and strength, and also shows good toughness,can satisfy you to make a more sturdy print,perfect for machine parts, home accessories and functional parts etc.NOTE:clean immediately instead of cooling naturally after use,avoid nozzle clogging.

      [Accurate & Consistent Dimension]Advanced CCD diameter measuring in the production process guarantee these PLA filaments of 1.75 mm diameter, Accuracy +/- 0.03 mm; Recommendate Nozzle Sizel0.6 mm ;Nozzle Temperature210- 240 ;1 kg spool (2.2lbs).Suitable for FDM 3D Printers.if you like 3D Printing and want to unlock your creativity, Geeetech PLA filament is an ideal filament material choice for you, which can bring lots of fun to your 3D prints.

      [Tangle Free & Easy to Print]This carbon fiber PLA filament improves strength and layer adhesion,low stringing, great adhesion, clog free, bubble free,and no warping,to avoid possible snagging and line breakage,and improve the print quality.Matte surface with with minimal layer lines,which can really help you to expand your capabilities of creating cool prints.

      [Professional Vacuum Packaging]As carbon fiber PLA filament is sensitive to humidity, Geeetech uses vacuum packaging with desiccant to keep the 3D printer filament dry and keep out dust and foreign particles.please make sure not to use it in high moisture environment and put it back to the resealable bad after use

      [Risk-Free & Lifetime Guarantee] With over 12 years'3D filaments experience, Geeetech 3D Prtiner Filaments are made with quality and sustainability in mind, worry-free 3D printing with Geeetech filament-Support by our lifetime satisfaction guarantee. We are a team full of passions for 3D printing and providing you with everything you need for a successful 3D printing experience.
