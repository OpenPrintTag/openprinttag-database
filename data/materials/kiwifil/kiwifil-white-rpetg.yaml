  White rPETG 3D printing filament, 1 kg, 1.75 mm (0.05 mm tolerance), made from 100% recycled plastic. The raw material is post-industrial scrap from the manufacturing of restaurant menu holders, store display cases, and similar products. 

  PETG prints almost as easy as PLA, but has a higher temperature resistance. PETG can take close to boiling water temperature without deforming. This means that you can use it for parts in your car, for example.

  Made in New Zealand, including the all-cardboard spool, the box, the bag, the label, and the instruction card.

  Recommended settings: Nozzle: 240-250degreesC. Bed: 70-85degreesC.

  Price is in New Zealand Dollars (NZD) and includes 15 % GST (Goods and Services Tax).

  >> Money back guarantee <<

  If this filament doesn't work well in your printer, let us know and we will refund you, no matter how little is left on your spool.
  >> Recycled plastic FAQ <<<

  Why is the recycled plastic filament more expensive than the regular filament?

  Recycling of plastic is very labour intensive. The material has be sourced, picked up, sorted, cleaned, shredded, and remelted. The extrusion process of shredded flakes is also more difficult than the extrusion process using perfectly sized virgin pellets. Products made from virgin material tend not to include these "end of life costs." However, closing the loop and minimizing our use of resources is important for a future on this planet, so we hope you are OK with paying a bit more for this recycled filament.

  Can I bring my discarded 3D prints for you for recycling? How about the spools, do you take those backs as well? 

  Yes, absolutely! We currently recycle PLA and PETG. You can ship it or drop it off at: KiwiFil 3D Ltd, 24 Campbell Street, Tokoroa, 3420, New Zealand. It is very important that PLA and PETG is separated and labelled. You don't have to sort the colours, but you will save us a lot of time and effort if you do so, so it would be much appreciated.

  We take back all the KiwiFil packaging for re-use: box, spool, bag, desiccant package,  instruction card, and any other packing material. The packing material will be re-used for new products, or recycled if the condition doesn't allow for re-use. We also happily take empty 1 kg plastic spools from other brands for re-use.
  >> A few things to keep in mind when you print PETG <<

      PETG is almost as easy to print as PLA. It has low odour and doesn't warp, but is more prone to stringing and may not give quite as perfect surface finish.
      PETG parts can handle higher temperature than PLA parts. PLA softens at around 60degreesC, while PETG can handle almost boiling water temperature without deforming.
      PETG is more sensitive to humidity than PLA. Store the spool in the plastic bag when you don't use it, and keep the relative humidity in your printer room or printer enclosure below 45%. If the spool has been exposed to humidity, you need to dry it before you use it. Search online for DIY drying solutions.
      This particular PETG appears to have very good bed adhesion. If you don't have a magnetic steel bed or similar bendable bed, print a small part first to make sure you can remove it easily before printing something large.
