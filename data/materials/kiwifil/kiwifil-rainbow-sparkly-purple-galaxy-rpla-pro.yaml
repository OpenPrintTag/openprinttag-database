description: |-
  "Sparkly Purple Galaxy" rainbow rPLA pro 3D printing filament, 1 kg, 1.75 mm (0.05 mm tolerance), made from 100 % recycled PLA. The raw material is post-industrial waste from the manufacturing of food packaging, discarded 3D prints, and filament that didn't meet our quality standards. 

  This filament has shades of purple and blue, with silver glitter. A complete cycle of colours is approximately 20 metres or 60 grams.

  Made in New Zealand, including the all-cardboard spool, the box, the bag, the label, and the instruction card.

  Recommended settings: Nozzle: 210-225degreesC. Bed: 50-65degreesC.

  Price is in New Zealand Dollars (NZD) and includes 15 % GST (Goods and Services Tax). 

  >> Money back guarantee <<

  Because this filament is made from 100 % recycled plastics, the colour and properties can vary slightly from batch to batch. The filament diameter is controlled twice - both in the extruding process and in the re-spooling process. We are also doing extensive test printing and mechanical testing to ensure this recycled plastic filament is as good as the virgin material.

  However, if this filament doesn't work well in your printer, let us know and we will refund you, no matter how little is left on your spool.

  >> Recycled plastic FAQ <<<

  Why is the recycled PLA filament more expensive than the regular PLA filament?

  Recycling of plastic is very labour intensive. The material has to be sourced, picked up, sorted, cleaned, shredded, and remelted. Products made from virgin material tend not to include these "end of life costs." However, closing the loop and minimizing our use of resources is important for a future on this planet, so we hope you are OK with paying a bit more for this recycled filament.

  Can I send my discarded 3D prints back for recycling? How about the spools, do you take those backs as well?

  Yes, absolutely! We currently recycle prints made from KiwiFil PLA pro, KiwiFil rPLA pro and KiwiFil PETG. It is very important that PLA and PETG is separated and labelled. You can find the detailed sorting instructions here: https://www.kiwifil.shop/pages/recycling

  We take back all the KiwiFil packaging for re-use: boxes, spools, bags, desiccant packages,  instruction cards, and any other packing material. The packing material will be re-used for new products, or recycled if the condition doesn't allow for re-use. We also happily take empty 1 kg plastic and fibreboard/cardboard spools from other brands for re-use.
