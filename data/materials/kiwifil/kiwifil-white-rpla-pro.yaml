  White rPLA pro 3D printing filament, 1 kg, 1.75 mm (0.05 mm tolerance), made from 100 % recycled plastic. It's made from post-industrial waste from the manufacturing of food packaging, from discarded and failed 3D prints that were shredded and remelted, and from filament that didn't meet our high quality standards.

  This gorgeous white rPLA prints with a smooth finish, and is indistinguishable from virgin (new) material. 

  Made in New Zealand, including the all-cardboard spool, the box, the bag, the label, and the instruction card.

  Recommended settings: Nozzle: 210-220degreesC. Bed: 50-60degreesC.

  Price is in New Zealand Dollars (NZD) and includes 15 % GST (Goods and Services Tax).

  Because this filament is made from 100 % recycled plastics, the colour and properties can vary slightly from batch to batch. We have a very meticulous quality control process that includes sorting, cleaning, grinding, and then twice filtering of the melted plastics before it is extruded into filament. The filament diameter is controlled twice - both in the extruding process and in the re-spooling process. We are also doing extensive test printing and mechanical testing to ensure this recycled plastic filament is as good as the virgin material.

  However, if this filament doesn't work well in your printer, let us know and we will refund you, no matter how little is left on your spool.

  >> Recycled plastic FAQ <<<

  Why is the recycled PLA filament more expensive than the regular PLA filament?

  Recycling of 3D prints into new filament is very labor intensive. The prints have to be sorted, cleaned, shredded, and melted before it is extruded into filament. This process also takes more equipment than making filament from virgin material. However, closing the loop and minimizing our use of resources is important for a future on this planet, so we hope you are OK with paying a bit more for the recycled PLA filament.

  Doesn't the transport of discarded 3D prints to the factory cause a lot of emissions? Wouldn't it be better to just put them in the trash and have them sent to the local landfill?

  All transports cause emissions, and our goal is to minimize the transports and their environmental effects. There is no domestic production of PLA plastic in New Zealand. All PLA is imported, unless it is made from recycled material. The KiwiFil virgin PLA comes from Thailand and is made from sugarcane. By recycling PLA that is already in the country, we can decrease the transports and  creating jobs in NZ.

  Why recycle? PLA is made from plants and it is compostable, right? Can't I just put my discarded prints in the regular trash or home compost?

  PLA is industrially compostable, while the conditions in a landfill or in a home compost are typically not correct for PLA to break down. Instead, it will likely be sitting in the landfill for hundreds of years. Also, even if PLA is made from plants, the production requires land, water, and energy, and causes emissions. PLA is relatively easy to recycle and can be remelted many times before it starts to lose its mechanical properties. Recycling PLA will also decrease the need for import of PLA plastic, keeping money and jobs here. So, why wouldn't you recycle it?

  Can I bring my discarded 3D prints for you for recycling? How about the spools, do you take those backs as well? 

  Yes, absolutely! We currently recycle PLA and PETG. Please contact us for shipping/drop-off address. It is very important that PLA and PETG is separated and labelled. We would also appreciate if you would sort it into different colours, but it isn't necessary.

  We offer 1$ per kg in store credit for returned prints. We also give store credit for KiwiFil spools, boxes, plastic ziplock, box cards, and desiccant packages bags. We will re-use the packaging if possible, or recycle it if the condition isn't good enough for use. As an alternative to store credit, you can choose to donate the amount to the Kiwi and Kakapo bird rescue, to tree planting and carbon offset, or to the Green Envy electric racing program.
