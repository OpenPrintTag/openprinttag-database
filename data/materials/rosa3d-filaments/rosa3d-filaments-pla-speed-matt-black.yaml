  ROSA 3D ReFill PLA Speed Matt filament in Black is the perfect combination of speed and exceptional aesthetics. Created for those who refuse to compromise – print at lightning speed and enjoy the flawless, matte finish of your projects.

  WHY CHOOSE PLA SPEED MATT?

      Print up to 4× faster. Save time with a formula that allows printing speeds over 400 mm/s — without losing quality or detail.
      Achieve a professional, matte finish. Give your prints a modern, elegant look that effectively masks layer lines and highlights the model’s shape.
      Forget about printing issues. With excellent layer adhesion and minimal shrinkage, working with this filament is easy and predictable. Perfect for both beginners and experts.
      Choose Polish quality and reliability. Manufactured in Poland, this filament guarantees consistent parameters and colors — essential for larger projects and serial production.
      Fully compatible with Bambu Lab AMS. The material is impact-resistant, flexible, and works flawlessly with filament changers such as the Bambu Lab AMS.

  APPLICATIONS:

  Ideal for rapid prototyping, printing concept models, gadgets, figurines, and decorative elements — where both speed and aesthetics matter.

  COMPATIBILITY WITH PROFILES:

      Bambu Lab printers: use the Bambu PLA Matte profile.
      Prusa printers (standard and High Flow nozzles): use the ROSA3D PLA Starter profile.

  REFILL:

  This is a ReFill-type spool insert. To use it, you’ll need a reusable Masterspool. You can print one yourself (the STL file is available in the “DOWNLOAD” section) or purchase it from our store. Print efficiently and sustainably.

  Choose speed without compromise. Add it to your cart and bring your projects to life faster than ever before.
