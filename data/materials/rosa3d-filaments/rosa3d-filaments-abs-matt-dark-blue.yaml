  FILAMENT 3D ABS+ Dark Blue is a versatile technical material with moderate shrinkage (0.4-0.7%). It features excellent processing properties, such as good flow, vibrant colors, and excellent layer adhesion, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The ABS+ filament from ROSA3D stands out for its high impact resistance. Prints made with this material have an elegant semi-matte finish, and their surfaces can be smoothed with acetone. Dark blue is perfect for printing decorations, jewelry, and sculptures.

  ABS+ Matt filament from ROSA3D is the perfect choice for those looking for an aesthetically pleasing matte 3D filament for professional applications. Thanks to its advanced formulation, this ABS filament with a matt finish eliminates the typical gloss effect that often gives models the appearance of cheap plastic. It is the ideal solution for 3D printing where visual quality and elegance are important – for both industrial and artistic projects.
