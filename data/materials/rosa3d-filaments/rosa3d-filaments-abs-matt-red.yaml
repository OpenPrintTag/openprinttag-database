description: |-
  FILAMENT 3D ABS+ Red is a versatile technical material with moderate shrinkage (0.4-0.7%). It features excellent processing properties, such as good flow, vibrant colors, and excellent layer adhesion, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

  The ABS+ filament from ROSA3D stands out for its high impact resistance. Prints made with this material have an elegant semi-matte finish, and their surfaces can be smoothed with acetone.

  The intense red color is perfect for printing artificial flowers, vases, and lampshades.

  Looking for a 3D filament that not only prints well, but also looks modern? ABS+ Matt from ROSA3D is the perfect material for you. Thanks to its unique formulation, this matte ABS filament eliminates the visual effect of plasticity while offering high mechanical resistance. It’s a great choice for anyone who needs an aesthetically pleasing 3D printing material with a matt finish, ideal for prototyping and final models.
