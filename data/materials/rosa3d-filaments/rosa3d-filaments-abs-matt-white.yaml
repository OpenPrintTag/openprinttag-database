description: |-
  FILAMENT 3D ABS+ White is a versatile technical material with moderate shrinkage (0.4-0.7%). It features excellent processing properties, such as good flow, vibrant colors, and excellent layer adhesion, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

  The ABS+ filament from ROSA3D stands out for its high impact resistance. Prints made with this material have an elegant semi-matte finish, and their surfaces can be smoothed with acetone.

  Its snow-white color makes it ideal for printing lampshades and diffusers, as well as sculptures and figurines intended for further painting.

  ABS+ Matt filament by ROSA3D combines the reliability of classic ABS with a modern matte effect that completely changes the visual quality of the prints. Models made with this matt 3D filament not only look great, but are also damage-resistant and easy to work with. This is an excellent option for users who expect more than standard glossy ABS filament can offer.
