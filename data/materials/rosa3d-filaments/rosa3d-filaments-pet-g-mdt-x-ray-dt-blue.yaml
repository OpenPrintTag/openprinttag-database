description: |-
  FILAMENT 3D ReFill PET-G MDT, x-Ray DT is a specialized filament designed for use in the food industry and in all applications where full control over the presence of foreign objects in the final product is required. It is detectable by both magnetic and X-ray detectors, even in very small quantities. This ensures effective elimination of contamination risks in production processes.

  WHY CHOOSE PET-G MDT?

      Detectable by metal detectors – both magnetic and X-ray. It is ferromagnetic but not a magnet itself (it does not adhere to surfaces like a magnet).
      Safe for food contact. Contains no toxic additives such as glass fibers, carbon fibers, or heavy metals.
      Resistant to moisture, mold, and fungi. Does not tarnish or develop patina.
      Dimensional stability and consistency. The material ensures high precision and no deformation.

  APPLICATIONS:

  Ideal for manufacturing containers, tools, production line components, packaging, covers, and molds.

  REFILL:

  This is a ReFill-type spool insert. To use it, you’ll need a reusable Masterspool. You can either print one yourself (the STL file is available in the “DOWNLOAD” section) or purchase it from our store. Print efficiently and sustainably.

  Take advantage of a fully safe filament that is both magnetically and X-ray detectable. Add it to your cart and bring your packaging-related projects to life.
