  FILAMENT 3D ReFill BioCREATE HT 1,75mm Reseda Green is an advanced biodegradable filament made entirely from renewable natural resources. It features high thermal resistance (Vicat softening temperature: 160°C), outperforming PLA, and has low shrinkage during printing, allowing it to be used in open-chamber 3D printers. The material is odorless, easy to print and post-process, and approved for food contact (final product certification is the responsibility of the manufacturer). Under proper composting conditions, it biodegrades within 12 weeks. Prints made with BioCREATE are even dishwasher-safe!

  BioCREATE HT is suitable for producing machine parts, decorative elements, tableware, furniture, molds, and cutters for modeling compounds. Thanks to its properties, it serves as an eco-friendly alternative to ABS and PET-G.
