description: |-
  3D printing filament ReFill PET-G Standard HS in Brick Red is a high-quality 3D printing material ideal for demanding users. Made from durable PET-G, it combines high mechanical resistance, excellent layer adhesion and ease of printing, making it a great choice for professionals and hobbyists alike.
  The ReFill PET-G Standard HS Brick Red filament is perfect for prototyping, production of usable and decorative parts. Thanks to its intense brick red colour, prints gain a unique aesthetic and professional look.
  The PET-G Standard HS (High Speed) filament is the ideal solution for 3D printing, providing excellent results at both standard and high printing speeds. Tests carried out on Bambu Lab P1P and Prusa MK4s printers using the GENERIC PET-G profile have confirmed that the material allows for maximum speeds without sacrificing detail quality. With PET-G Standard HS, users can simultaneously increase printing productivity and maintain the perfect precision of their prints.

  NOTE! The ReFill version of the filament requires the use of Masterspool discs, which can be purchased separately or printed on the 3D printer yourself.
