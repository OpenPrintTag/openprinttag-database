  Our Tough Pro PLA+ is the best PLA filament for 3D printing your most demanding projects. When you're looking for a tough PLA with excellent temperature resistance that prints as smooth as butter, 3D-Fuel Tough Pro PLA+ is the material for you.

  Manufactured in the US from genuine NatureWorksTM 3D870 Ingeo PLA, Tough Pro PLA+ offers a third-generation level of material engineering for 3D printing. Since it's a NatureWorks PLA material, it's a sustainably sourced bio-plastic with an incredible eco-profile. 

  Tough Pro PLA+ has higher impact strength than ABS and Standard PLA+ with a heat resistance that rivals that of ABS. That's even before any post-processing.

  Tough Pro PLA+ was designed with the high impact strength needed in industrial applications to meet the growing demand for a material with the properties of ABS and the printability of PLA.
