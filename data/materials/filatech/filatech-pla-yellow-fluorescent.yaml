description: |-
  PLA (Polylactic Acid) is one of the two most commonly used desktop 3D printing filaments (with the other being ABS filament). It is the “default” recommended material for many desktop 3D printers, and with good reason – PLA is useful in a broad range of printing applications, has the virtue of being both odorless and low-warp, and does not require a heated bed. PLA filament is also one of the eco-friendliest 3D printer materials available; it is made from annually renewable resources (corn-starch) and requires less energy to process compared to traditional (petroleum-based) plastics. Outside of 3D printing, PLA plastic is often used in food containers, such as candy wrappers, and biodegradable medical implants, such as sutures. Our PLA filaments for 3D Printing are available in a wide range of colors in both 1.75mm and 2.85mm.

  The latest range of PLA filaments have been developed by our expert engineers utilizing the latest technology and high quality prime virgin raw material.
