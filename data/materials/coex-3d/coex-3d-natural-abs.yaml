description: |-
  ABS+ filament is an advanced thermoplastic 3d printing filament.  ABS, which stands for Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene. Coex ABS + or ABS Prime is an engineering grade material made from a higher grade base resin which will provide an even stronger finished print than the standard Coex ABS filament.  ABS is used by a variety of manufacturing industries for parts requiring structural integrity and detail and is commonly used in rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing environments to test product impact resistance and durability.  This 3D printer filament is available in 1.75 and 2.85 MM in diameter, and comes in 500 g, 5 lbs, 15 lbs and 1 kg.
   

  As opposed to PLA and PETG filament, ABS Prime is a bit more technical and may be more challenging for new 3D printing users and requires the use of an enclosed 3D printer.  ABS is a stiff 3D printing material that will be impact and heat resistant. Common applications for ABS include end-use tools, moving parts, and parts that must withstand high mechanical stress.
