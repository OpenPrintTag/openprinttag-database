description: |-
  ABS filament is a thermoplastic 3d printer filament ABS, which stands for Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene. It easily molds when heated and sets evenly when cooled.  ABS filament is used by a variety of manufacturing industries for parts requiring  structural integrity and detail, and is ideal for "wear and tear" projects. It is commonly used in rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing environments to test product impact resistance and durability. It is also popular with 3D printing hobbyist who utilize 3D printing in their home or at a local maker faire.  This 3D printer filament comes in a variety of colors and is available in 1.75 and 2.85 MM in diameter, and comes in 500 g, 5 lbs, 15 lbs and 1 kg.

  As opposed to PLA and PETG filament, ABS is a bit more technical and may be more challenging for new 3D printing users and requires the use of an enclosed 3D printer.  ABS is a stiff 3D printing material and it is impact and heat resistant. Common applications for ABS include end-use tools, moving parts, and parts that have to withstand high mechanical stress.
