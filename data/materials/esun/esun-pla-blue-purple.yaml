      [Easy to Print & Excellent Mechanic Performance]Improved based on ordinary PLA, Upgraded PLA Filament has better toughness and higher strength while maintaining the characteristic of easy to print .More durable and not easy to break with gorgeous smooth printing effect. User-friendly for beginners.

      [Dimensional Tolerance Consistency]1 kg spool (2.2lbs) with Accuracy +/- 0.03 mm, eSUN Upgraded PLA Filament 1.75mm 3D printer filament are produced with minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints. Suitable for almost all 1.75mm FDM 3D printers.

      [Tangle Free & Clog Free]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.No bubbles, less stringing, high successful printing rate.

      [Cost-effective & Wide Application]Good layer adhesion performance meets your demands for printing functional parts with higher toughness. Widly used in machinery, electronic appliances, automobiles, decorations, COSPLAY and other field.

      [Environmental Friendly & Recyclable]eSUN Upgraded PLA Filament 3D printing filament is made with starch raw materials derived from renewable plant resources. Low odor. Scrap is reused to produce recyclable paper spool & packaging box.Come in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition.
