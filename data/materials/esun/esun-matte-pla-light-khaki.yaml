      [Delicate Matte PLA]With excellent matte printed surface, eSUN Matte PLA has better printing effect and doesn't have obvious layer lines than normal PLA. Not easy to break. Supporting structure of it is easy to peel off. Compatible with Most of FDM 3D Printers, such as: Bambu Lab P1P /X1, Voron 2.4, Raise3D, Prusa, Creality Ender 3 and Ender 7.

      [High Toughness & Better Adhesion]Compared to normal PLA filament, eSUN Matte PLA has higher toughness.Printed models are not easy to break or crack, which can be widly used in accessory, home decoration, toy, sculpture, shell and COSPLAY. With upgraded paper reel, eSUN Matte PLA has better adhesion and printibility which improves the problem of bottom adhesion on the plate.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, good layer bonding, less stringing, no bubbles, easy handling, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder, high successful printing rate.

      [Environmental Friendly Package & Reel]Scrap is reused to produce recyclable spool and packaging box. eSUN filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
