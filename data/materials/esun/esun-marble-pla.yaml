      [Marble PLA Filament]Marble PLA adds a nature realistic marble visualization to the 3D printed project. The subtle marble tones is randomly dispersed throughout the print creating a unique look. Perfect for arts & crafts projects, vases and other items.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, no clogging, no bubbles, extremely high successful rate, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, does not overlap or tangle, less stringing, strong layer adhesion. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.

      [Environmental Friendly PLA]Marble PLA is a mixture of PLA and marble elements, which produces natural marble effect. Made with starch raw materials derived from renewable plant resources, biodegradable and eco-friendly, non-toxic and low odor.

      [Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]1KG Spool Marble PLA Filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
