      [Enhanced Toughness PLA+]PLA+ is an enhanced version of ordinary PLA. It has higher strength and better toughness, not easy to break. Made with starch raw materials derived from renewable plant resources, eco-friendly and non-toxic, no harm to to human and the environment.

      [High Speed Printing]PLA+ meets the demands for high-speed printers and keeps outstanding performance at high speeds. And it also keeps all the advantages of PLA, easy to print, low shrinkage, no deformation, no cracking, high printing precision. Good layer bonding performance meets your demands for printing functional parts with higher toughness.

      [Dimensional Tolerance +/- 0.03mm]eSUN PLA+ 3D printer filaments are produced with more precise specification. Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [High Compatibility]Compatible with Most of FDM 3D Printers, such as: Bambu Lab X1/X1C, Creality K1 /K1 MAX , AnkerMake M5, Prusa, MakerBot, UltiMaker, MK3, Ender 3, Flashforge, Raise3D, FLSUN V400, Voron 2.4. Widly used in machinery, electronic appliances, automobiles, decorations and COSPLAY.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 3KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder, high printing successful rate.
