      [High Speed PETG Filament]Combines the advantages of PLA and ABS, eSUN high speed PETG has the advantages of high toughness and good mechanical properties (like ABS), also has the characteristics of ease to print and minimum warping (like PLA). Good Impact Resistance. Weather Resistance. Chemical Resistance. Good Stability.

      [High Speed Printing & High Compatibility]Designed for high speed printers. Fast cooling with high speed printing. Continues consistently outstanding performance at high speeds. Compatible with Bambu Lab X1 / X1C / P1P ,Creality K1 / K1 Max and AnkerMake M5. Widely used in waterproof application, snap-fit, flower pot, equipment shell, etc.

      [High Printing Successful Rate]Optimizing the problem of nozzle adhesion during printing and reduce the printing failure. Good layer bonding, less stringing, no bubbles, no cracking, easy handling, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder. Stable dimensional tolerance.

      [Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]Filament Net Weight: 1KG. eSUN filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
