      [Easy to Print]High Speed PLA+ is an enhanced version based on ordinary PLA. It has higher strength and better toughness, not easy to break. Low shrinkage, no deformation, no cracking, high printing precision. Made with starch raw materials derived from plant resources, ideal for indoor printing.

      [Designed for High Speed Printing]Printing Speed 50-300mm/s. Meet the demands for high speed printers. Continues consistently outstanding performance at high speed. Compatible with Bambu Lab X1 / X1C / P1P ,Creality K1 / K1 Max and AnkerMake M5. Widely used in machinery, electronic appliances, automobiles, decorations, COSPLAY and other items.

      [Dimensional Tolerance +/- 0.03mm]eSUN High Speed PLA+ 3D printer filaments are produced with more precise specification. Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, no bubbles, less stringing, extremely high successful rate.Good layer bonding performance meets your demands for printing functional parts with higher toughness.

      [High Precision & Smooth Extrusion]eSUN High Speed PLA+ can maintain the printing quality and retain the integrity of the complete fine structures without layer lines and deformation while printing in high speed. Also, it has extraordinary bridging and overhang performance with smooth surface.

      [Environmental Friendly Package & Cardboard Reel]Tangle free and no plugging. Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.Recyclable spool and vacuum sealed packaging box.
