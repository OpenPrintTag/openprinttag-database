   [Water Soluble PVA]Water-soluble Polymer. Excellent Water Solubility. Easy to Peel off, Will not Damage Printed Surface. Good Bonding to Various Material Such as PLA. Environmental-friendly and Non-toxic. Ideal for Complex Prints!

  [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, no clogging, no bubbles, extremely high successful rate, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

  [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 0.5KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, does not overlap or tangle, less stringing, strong layer adhesion. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.

  [Support Material]Thanks to its solubility in water, makes it possible to print complex models and mobile constructions that no longer need to be assembled from individual parts. Simply wash away the support structure by immersing the model in water.

  [Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]0.5KG Spool Water Soluble PVA Filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
