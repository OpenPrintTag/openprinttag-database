      [Heat Resistance Carbon Fiber Filled Nylon]80% Nylon Coupled with 20% Carbon Fiber, which makes it has higher rigidity and strength than normal nylon filament. Good Toughness. Wear Resistance and Tear Resistance. High Precision & Low Shrinkage. Creep Resistance and less warpage. Heat Resistance 120degreesC. Flame Retardance UL94-V2. Matte Printed Surface.

      [Clog-free & Bubble-Free & Less-tangle]Full mechanical winding and strict manual examination ensure tangling free and avoid filament breaking and snapping.eSUN Carbon Fiber Filled Nylon filament is orderly wrapped, melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.It does not overlap or tangle,no cracking.

      [Wide Application]Compatible with most of FDM 3D Printers that use 1.75MM filament and suitable for making both strong and flexible industrial parts, prosthetics, medical equipment and complex costumes etc.Recommend Carbon Fiber Nylon filament extrusion / Nozzle temperature 260-290, bed 45-60.Due to its unique attribute of abrasiveness, we recommend to use a 0.6mm or larger stainless steel nozzle instead of regular soft metal nozzles.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]3D printer filaments are produced with high precise specification and have a tolerance of only +/- 0.05mm. Full 1KG 3d printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance.Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints.

      [100% Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]Complete drying for 24 hours before packaging, eSUN filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag to keep it dry and prevent from dust and foreign particles, avoid nozzle jams and yield smooth 3D models.PLEASE NOTICE THAT THE SPOOL IS NON-DETACHABLE!
