      [High Toughness & High Strength]Improved based on ordinary PLA, eSUN PLA CF carbon fiber PLA filament adds organic infiltrated chopped carbon fiber imported from Germany, which makes it present a better carbon fiber performance. High flexural modulus. Less wear on nozzles compared to PA CF.

      [Low Shrinkage & Low Water Absorption]Compared to PA CF, eSUN PLA CF has lower shrinkage and lower water absorption. Also, because it is based on PLA, it has the characteristic of PLA and doesn't need to print in enclosed chamber.No bubbles, less stringing, high successful printing rate.Stable dimensional tolerence.Good winding, does not overlap or tangle.

      [Shine-free Matte Printed Surface]With chopped carbon fiber added, eSUN PLA CF presents an excellent shine-free matte printed surface and distinctive carbon fiber frosted texture. Also, the printed model doesn't have obvious layer lines compared to normal PLA.

      [ High Speed Printing & Fast Cooling]eSUN PLA CF can maintain the printing quality and retain the integrity of the complete fine structures without layer lines and deformation while printing in high speed.Fast cooling.Printing Speed 50-300mm/s.Compatible with Bambu Lab X1/ X1C and P1P/ AnkerMake M5/ Voron 2.4 / Flsun V400/ Creality K1/ K1 Max and Ender 7/ Raise 3D Pro 3.

      [High Compatibility & Wide Application] Whether used as structural components or for aesthetic purposes, PLA CF effortlessly excels, thanks to its outstanding attributes.Widely used in machinery, chemical industry, fixture, robots, unmanned aerial vehicle, automobiles, textile, aerospace and other field.

      [Cardboard Spool Adapter STL File]For users on Bambu Lab AMS, we have designed 1kg paper/cardboard spool adapter STL file for you to print and install for smooth printing. You can find 1kg paper/cardboard spool adapter STL file in our official website (Named: eSUN Paper Spool Adaptor or eSUN paper spool solution for Bambu Lab AMS, you can choose one of them to print, estimated time is 30 minutes) : https://www.esun3d.com/zldownload_catalog/model-download/
