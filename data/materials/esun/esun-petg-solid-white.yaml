      [PETG Filament]PETG not only has the advantages of high toughness and good mechanical properties (like ABS), but also has the characteristics of ease of print and minimum warp (like PLA).Suitable for printing functional parts that needs higher toughness.

      [Complete Functional ]Excellent Clarity, Light Transmission and High Gloss. Waterproof. High Toughness. Good Impact Resistance. Good Mechanical Strength. Weather Resistance. Chemical Resistance. Good Stability.

      [Clog-free & Bubble-Free & Less-tangle]Full mechanical winding and strict manual examination to avoid any tangling issues.No overlap or tangle, no clogging and no cracking, printing models that have smooth and stable surface finish.

      [Dimensional Accuracy & Consistency] Dimensional Tolerance +/- 0.03mm. Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, no bubbles, less stringing, extremely high successful rate.

      [Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]Filament Net Weight: 1KG. eSUN filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
