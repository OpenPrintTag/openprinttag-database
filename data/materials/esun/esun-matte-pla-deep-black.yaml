      [Delicate Matte PLA]With excellent matte printed surface, eSUN Matte PLA has better printing effect and doesn't have obvious layer lines than normal PLA. Not easy to break. Supporting structure of it is easy to peel off. Compatible with Most of FDM 3D Printers, such as: Bambu Lab P1P / X1 / X1C / A1 / A1 Mini, Voron 2.4, Raise3D, Prusa, Creality Ender 3 and Ender 7.

      [Refill Matte PLA & Detachable Reusable Spool]Bundle of eSUN 1.75mm 1kg spoolless refill Matte PLA and upgarded removable filament reel eSpool+. This new set can be compatible with AMS and most of 3d printers. Detachable reel is reusable with high compatibility.

      [High Toughness & Better Adhesion]Compared to normal PLA filament, eSUN Matte PLA has higher toughness. Printed models are not easy to break or crack, which can be widly used in accessory, home decoration, toy, sculpture, shell and COSPLAY. Better adhesion and printibility.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, good layer bonding, less stringing, no bubbles, easy handling, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder, high successful printing rate.
