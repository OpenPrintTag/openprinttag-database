      [High Speed ABS+ Filament]eSUN high speed ABS+ is an enhanced version of ordinary ABS, cracking and warping has been significantly improved when printing large-size items. It has high strength, better toughness, excellent impact strength, wear resistance, heat resistance. Higher heat distortion temperature than ABS+ and ABS. Lower shrinkage rate and lower odor compared to ordinary ABS.

      [Designed for High Speed Printing]eSUN high speed ABS plus can maintain the printing quality and retain the integrity of the complete fine structures without layer lines and deformation while printing in high speed.Printing Speed 50-300mm/s.Compatible with Bambu Lab X1/ X1C / P1P, Voron 2.4, Prusa, Creality K1/ K1 Max/ Ender 3 / Ender 7, and Raise 3D Pro 3.

      [Better Layer Adhesion]Stable dimensional tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, better layer adhesion than ABS+, less stringing, no bubbles, no cracking, easy handling, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.

      [High Compatibility & Wide Application]Acetone polishing is available, which can keep smooth surface of printed models. Strong and durable high speed ABS+ filament is engineering thermoplastic. Suitable for printing parts with higher requirements for resistance to heat, such as industrial machinery parts, toys, automobiles,model machinery, electronic appliances and instrumentation.

      [Cardboard Spool Adapter STL File]For users on Bambu Lab AMS, we have designed 1kg paper/cardboard spool adapter STL file for you to print and install for smooth printing. You can find 1kg paper/cardboard spool adapter STL file in our official website (Named: eSUN Paper Spool Adaptor or eSUN paper spool solution for Bambu Lab AMS, you can choose one of them to print, estimated time is 30 minutes) : https://www.esun3d.com/zldownload_catalog/model-download/
