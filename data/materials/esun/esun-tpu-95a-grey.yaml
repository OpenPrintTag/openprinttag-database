      [Flexible TPU-95A]Hardness 95A. Strong Flexibility. High Resilience. Elongation at break 800%. High Transparency. High Impact Strength. Wear Resistance. Tear Resistance. Inflection Resistance. Resistant to Oil, Solvent and Scratches. Weather Resistance. Chemical Resistance.

      [Good Flexibility]Flexible TPU is durable and stretchable thermoplastic polyurethane. Its shape can be changed by external force and bounce back when the force disappears. Soft TPU-95A filament of high elasticity is easy to print and offers excellent layer-to-layer bonding.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, good layer bonding, less stringing, no bubbles, no cracking, no deformation, easy handling, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder, high printing successful rate.

      [High Compatibility]TPU-95A filament is compatible with Most of Direct End and Broden End 3D Printers, such as: Ender 3, Raise3D, Prusa, Voron, etc. It has excellent printability and high fluidity, suitable for high-flow and high-speed printing applications. Widely used in keyrings, insoles, watch bands, mobile phone cases and more!
