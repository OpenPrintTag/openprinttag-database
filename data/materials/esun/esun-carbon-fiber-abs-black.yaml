      [Enhanced Composite ABS CF]Adding carbon fiber reinforcement on modifying ABS, ABS CF enhances the rigidity and toughness of ABS, providing excellent impact resistance and chemical corrosion resistance.Matte appearance with carbon fiber frosted texture.Heat distortion temperature up to 95.

      [High Strength & Wear Resistance]High strength and toughness, as well as wear resistance and durable, making it perform exceptionally well in scenarios requiring high strength, such as jigs and fixtures.

      [Outstanding Impact Resistance]eSUN ABS CF has superior impact resistance compared to standard ABS, thanks to the addition of carbon fiber reinforcement, which allows it to better absorb and disperse energy upon impact.

      [Chemical Corrosion Resistance]ABS CF exhibits good chemical corrosion resistance, making it suitable for industrial applications with harsh chemical environments, such as components and casings for chemical equipment.

      [Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]Filament Net Weight: 1KG. eSUN filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
