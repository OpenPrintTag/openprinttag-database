      [Easy to Print]PLA+ is an enhanced version of ordinary PLA. It has higher strength and better toughness, not easy to break. low shrinkage, no deformation, no cracking, high printing precision. Made with starch raw materials derived from plant resources, ideal for indoor printing.

      [Refill PLA Plus & Detachable Reusable Spool]Bundle of eSUN 1.75mm 1kg spoolless refill PLA Plus and upgarded removable filament reel eSpool+. This new set can be compatible with AMS and most of 3d printers. Detachable reel is reusable with high compatibility. Please notice that the detachable spool has been pre-installed with the refill PLA Plus.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Total Length: 340-350m. Full 1KG 3D printer refilament perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder. Meet the high speed printing demand for high-speed printers. Continues consistently outstanding performance at high speeds.

      [Dimensional Tolerance +/- 0.03mm]eSUN PLA+ 3D printer filaments are produced with more precise specification. Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, no bubbles, less stringing, extremely high successful rate.

      [High Compatibility]Compatible with Most of FDM 3D Printers, such as:Bambu Lab P1P / X1 / X1C / A1 / A1 Mini, AnkerMake M5, Creality K1 / K1 Max, Voron 2.4, FLSUN V400, Prusa, UltiMaker, MK3, Ender 3, MakerBot, Flashforge, Raise3D. Good layer bonding performance meets your demands for printing functional parts with higher toughness. Widly used in machinery, electronic appliances, automobiles, decorations, COSPLAY and other items.
