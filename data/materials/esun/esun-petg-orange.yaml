      [PETG Filament]Excellent Clarity, Light Transmission and High Gloss. Waterproof. High Toughness. Good Impact Resistance. Good Mechanical Strength. Weather Resistance. Chemical Resistance. Good Stability. Combines the advantages of PLA and ABS.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, good layer bonding, less stringing, no bubbles, no cracking, easy handling, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Total Length: 350-355m. Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.

      [High Compatibility]PETG has the advantages of high toughness and good mechanical properties (like ABS), also has the characteristics of ease to print and minimum warping (like PLA). Widely used in toys, stationery, electronic accessories, cosmetic container, etc.

      [Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]Filament Net Weight: 1KG. eSUN filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
