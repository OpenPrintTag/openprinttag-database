       [Delicate Dual Color Matte PLA]With excellent matte printed surface, eSUN Dual Color Matte PLA has dual color coextrusion printing effect and displays a sense of color hierarchy while maintaining color separation, making the appearance of the model both rich and delicate. It doesn't have obvious layer lines than normal PLA. Not easy to break. Supporting structure of it is easy to peel off.

      [High Toughness & Good Adhesion]Compared to normal PLA filament, eSUN Dual Color Matte PLA has higher toughness.Printed models are not easy to break or crack, which can be widly used in accessory, home decoration, toy, sculpture, shell and COSPLAY. Compatible with Most of FDM 3D Printers, such as: Bambu Lab P1P / P1S / X1 / X1C / A1 / A1 mini, Voron 2.4, Raise3D, Prusa, Creality Ender 3 and Ender 7.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, good layer bonding, less stringing, no bubbles, easy handling, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder, high successful printing rate.

      [Environmental Friendly Package & Reel]Scrap is reused to produce recyclable spool and packaging box. eSUN filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
