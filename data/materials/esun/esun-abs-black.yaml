      [ABS+ Filament]ABS+ is an enhanced version of Ordinary ABS, cracking and warping has been significantly improved when printing large-size items. It has high strength, better toughness, excellent impact strength, wear resistance and heat resistance.Compatible with Most of FDM 3D Printers, such as:Bambu Lab P1P /X1, Voron 2.4, Raise3D, Prusa, Creality Ender 3 and Ender 7.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, good layer bonding, less stringing, no bubbles, no cracking, easy handling, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]2.5KG 3D printer filament reel per roll, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.

      [High Compatibility]Strong and durable ABS+ filament is engineering thermoplastic. Suitable for printing parts with higher requirements for resistance to heat, such as industrial machinery parts, model machinery, electronic appliances and instrumentation.

      [Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]Filament Net Weight: 2.5KG. eSUN filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
