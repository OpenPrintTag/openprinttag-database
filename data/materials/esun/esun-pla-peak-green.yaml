      [ Easy to Print]PLA+ is an enhanced version of ordinary PLA. It has higher strength and better toughness, not easy to break. low shrinkage, no deformation, no cracking, high printing precision. Made with starch raw materials derived from plant resources, ideal for indoor printing.

      [High Speed Printing]Meet the demands for high-speed printers. Continues consistently outstanding performance at high speeds. Compatible with Bambu Lab X1 / X1C / P1P ,Creality K1 / K1 Max and AnkerMake M5.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Total Length: 340-350m. Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.

      [Dimensional Tolerance +/- 0.03mm]eSUN PLA+ 3D printer filaments are produced with more precise specification. Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, no bubbles, less stringing, extremely high successful rate.

      [High Compatibility]Compatible with Most of FDM 3D Printers, such as:Bambu Lab P1P / X1 / X1C, AnkerMake M5, Creality K1 / K1 Max, Voron 2.4, FLSUN V400, Prusa, UltiMaker, MK3, Ender 3, MakerBot, Flashforge, Raise3D. Good layer bonding performance meets your demands for printing functional parts with higher toughness. Widly used in machinery, electronic appliances, automobiles, decorations, COSPLAY and other items.
