      [Super Tough PLA]PLA-ST is an toughened version of ordinary PLA. Elongation at Break is up to 90%, better toughness and bending resistance, not easy to break. 11 times stronger than PLA at Impact Strength. Suitable for printing mechanical parts with higher requirements for impact resistance and precision.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, good layer bonding, less stringing, no bubbles, no cracking, no deformation, easy handling, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder, high printing successful rate.

      [High Compatibility]Super Tough PLA filament is compatible with Most of FDM 3D Printers. Widely used in mechanical models, structural parts and functional parts, such as industrial design, consumer electronics, auto parts, IT manufacturing, mechanical and electrical fields.

      [Good Printability]Super Tough PLA keeps all the advantages of PLA, easy to print. Recommended Extrusion / Nozzle Temperature 200-230, Bed Temperature 45-60degreesC. PLA-ST has general rigid, we recommend reducing printing speed when remote end printing to prevent poor feed.
