      [Outstanding Heat Resistance]eSUN PET is renowned for its exceptional heat resistance, with a heat resistance up to approximately 75degreesC, significantly higher than PLA filament, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring heat resistance.

      [High Toughness & Durability]PET is not only heat-resistant but also possesses high toughness, which can withstand repeated bending and impacts in daily use without breaking, providing you with long-lasting and durable printed models.

      [Efficient High Speed Printing Experience]Compared to PETG, eSUN PET filament has a lower printing temperature, reducing stringing during the printing process, allowing you to achieve high speed printing while maintaining dimensional accuracy and minimizing stringing, meeting your dual demands for efficiency and quality. Please notice the printing speed of PET will be slower than eSUN high speed series filaments.

      [Excellent Printing Results]PET offers superior printing results, satisfying your high demands for appearance whether in solid or transparent colors. Transparent color PET is particularly suitable for applications requiring transparent or translucent effects, such as lighting fixtures and illuminated signage.

      [Wide Application]PET is widely used in aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications due to its excellent performance. Its high tensile strength, durability, chemical resistance, and wear resistance make it a key material for enhancing safety, functionality, and service life in these fields.
