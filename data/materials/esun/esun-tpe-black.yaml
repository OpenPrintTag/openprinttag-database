      [Flexible TPE 83A]Hardness Shore 83A. Strong Flexibility. High Resilience. High Strength. High Mechanical Strength. Wear Resistance. Tear Resistance. Inflection Resistance. Water-, Cold-, Heat-, and UV Resistance. Good Aging Resistance.

      [Stable Dimensional Tolerance]Minimum tolerance and low warping to ensure consistent feeding and stable prints, no clogging, no bubbles, extremely high successful rate, resulting in an outstanding surface finish and are highly precise.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, does not overlap or tangle, less stringing, strong layer adhesion. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.

      [Wide Application]Flexible TPE filament is durable and stretchable material which prints strong parts that are also flexible, it resumes its initial shape after being stretched. Great for a variety of projects, such as shoe insoles, watch bands, phone cases, drone parts and more!

      [Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]1KG Spool Flexible TPE-83A Filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
