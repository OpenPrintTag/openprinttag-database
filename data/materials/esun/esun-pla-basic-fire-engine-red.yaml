      [PLA Basic Filament]Improved based on ordinary PLA, eSUN PLA Basic filament not only retains the characteristics of PLA, but also has better fluidity and fast printing performance with special materials added, which makes it an ideal choice of cost-effective fast printing filament.

      [High Compatibility]Compatible with Most of FDM 3D Printers and high speed printers, such as:Bambu Lab P1P / P1S / X1 / X1C / A1 / A1 mini, AnkerMake M5, Creality K1 / K1 Max, Voron 2.4, FLSUN V400, Prusa, UltiMaker, MK3, Ender 3 / Ender 7, MakerBot, Flashforge, Raise3D.

      [Easy To Print]No bubbles, less stringing, high successful printing rate. Low Odor. No warping, low shrinkage, no deformation, no cracking. High printing precision and good molding effect. Made with starch raw materials derived from renewable plant resources.Widely used in cultural creativity, animation industry, film and television props and other fields.

      [Tangle Free & No Plugging]Full 1KG 3D printer filament reel, perfect roundness and very tight diameter tolerance, good winding, does not overlap or tangle. Melt well, feed smoothly and constantly without clogging the nozzle or extruder.

      [Vacuumed Sealed Packaging]Filament Net Weight: 1KG. eSUN filament comes in a sealed vacuum bag with a desiccant bag, easily keep your 3D printer filaments at an optimal storage condition and free from dust or dirt before opening the vacuumed sealed packaging.
