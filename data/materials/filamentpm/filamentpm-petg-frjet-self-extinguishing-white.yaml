  FRJet this material is based on PETG and contains a mixture of special additives with a flame-retardant (UL94 V0 certification). It is ideal for electronic components.

  FRJet is a revolutionary material in the field of 3D printing, becoming a popular choice in the electronics industry. Thanks to its unique properties associated with self-extinguishing and flame retardancy, it is ideal for applications where resistance to burning is emphasized. Its high-temperature resistance, dimensional stability, and good layer adhesion ensure that printed objects are sturdy and durable. FRJet is a testament to our commitment to providing quality and safe materials for 3D printing.

  Key Features:

      Self-extinguishing and flame retardant: Meets the UL94 V0 safety standard, ensuring high resistance to burning.
      PETG-based material: Contains a mixture of special additives with a flame retardant.
      High-temperature resistance: The material is resistant up to 70degreesC.
      Good layer adhesion: Ensures strength and integrity of printed objects.
      Dimensional stability: For precision and print quality.
      Safety aspect: Contains 20% flame retardant additive.
