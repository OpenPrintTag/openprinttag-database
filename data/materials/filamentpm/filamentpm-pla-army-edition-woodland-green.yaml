  PLA+ Army Edition includes four NEW matte colors: Ranger Gray, Dusty Brown, Desert Beige, and Woodland Green. Using these colors you are able to print different kinds of military vehicles, toy soldiers, jeeps, bunkers, or dummy weapons. It is also great for Printing Airsoft, Camping, or Survival Accessories. If you are using Multi-material Printing, you are able to print also Camouflage models. Moreover, if you combine PLA+ Army edition with PLA+ Pastel edition, you can print ordinary things for house decoration as cactuses and so on.

  PLA+ (polylactic acid)
  - improved printing properties compared to standard PLA:

      lower printing temperature 195 degreesC - great for bridging and printing overhangs
      higher adhesion of layers and impact toughness - ie. that the printed object is more flexible when bending
      higher viscosity = doesn't clog the nozzle
      the material withstands insufficient cooling of the printer in a warm environment (for example in the summer months), precisely because of the lower printing temperatures used and the higher viscosity
      is suitable for 3D pens, again due to lower temperatures
      has an attractive matte finish
      is offered in the new Skin edition, Army edition, classic Black&White, modern Pastel edition, hot Summer edition, or recycled RePLA+
