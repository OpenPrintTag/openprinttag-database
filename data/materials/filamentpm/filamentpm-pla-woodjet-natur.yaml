  The best way to bring the beauty of nature into your 3D printing!

  The new and improved formula with bamboo additive creates a perfect illusion of wood and forms stunning details as if they were made from natural materials. And the best part? With the new WoodJet, you don't have to worry about clogging the nozzle, so you can be sure of a perfect result.

  But that's not all! The new WoodJet is made from high-quality PLA+ modified material that is eco-friendly, so you can print without worrying about the environment. Additionally, we have decided to stop using sugar beet residues and instead have opted for a much more sustainable alternative.

  What does this mean for you? You'll get a high-quality and eco-friendly filament that adapts to your needs and allows you to create perfect details with natural effects. So why wait?
