  PrimaSELECT SELECT Luvocom 3F 9676 PEEK CF

  PrimaSELECT Luvocom 3F 9676 PEEK CF is a 15% carbon fiber reinforced PEEK (Polyether Ether Ketone) with extraordinary properties in terms of mechanical, thermal and chemical resistance. PEEK with carbon is used in demanding industries such as oil and gas, automotive, mechanical engineering, aircraft and space technology. This high performance polymer grade is tailored for the 3D printing industry to match injection molding strength requirements and focuses on serial production of end parts.
  3D printing of PEEK replaces various polymer and metal components

  PEEK is most often used to replace various polymer and metal components in cars, machinery and aircraft. Thanks to a very high heat and chemical resistance, PEEK can be used in many ways that metal components are usually used. It can maintain its properties for a long time at high operating temperatures. PEEK is also used in the medical field as it is perfect for making custom prosthetic parts such as arms, hands and skull implants.
  Easier to 3D print PEEK filament

  For a long time, PEEK was one of the most difficult materials to 3D print, but after much research, an additive was invented and PEEK Luvocom was introduced. The new additive has changed the way PEEK can be used as it now works better with FDM 3D printers.
  Perfect manufacturing process ensures high quality of the PEEK filaments

  SELECT Peek never comes into contact with water during the manufacturing process and is packaged directly in vacuum sealed bags. This and the additive create a PEEK filament with excellent layer adhesion, which of course greatly improves impact resistance, durability and strength, and also makes the printing process much easier than with regular PEEK.
  3D Printer Recommendations for 3D Printing PEEK CF Filament

      Temperature of printer nozzle: 400 - 450degreesC
      Heated bed temperature: 110degreesC
      Print speed: 15 - 30 mm/s
      Adhesion of bed: Magigoo HT on glass or a PEI sheet
      Recommendations for pre-drying: 120degreesC, 4 - 8 hours

   

  To get the best results when printing, we recommend that you store the 3D printer in a room where there is hardly any draft and/or temperature fluctuations. When the 3D printer is not in use, it is important to store the filament in a bag and store it in a cool, dry and dark place until it is used again.
