Our filament series is created for the modern generation of printers, focusing on unmatched quality and performance. Whether youre an experienced user or a beginner, PrimaSELECT ASA will turn your creations into true masterpieces.

      Fast printing: Optimized to meet the demands for high print speeds, saving valuable time without compromising quality.
      Reduced odor issues: Our Select series ASA reduces unpleasant odors compared to cheaper alternatives, creating a more pleasant working environment. However, we recommend using it in well-ventilated spaces for the best experience.
      Affordable: Offers superior quality at a competitive price, making PrimaSELECT ASA the obvious choice for all your 3D printing needs.
      Beautiful and vibrant colors: Our range of vibrant colors allows you to bring your ideas to life with outstanding detail and aesthetics.
      UV-resistant: Perfect for outdoor use, as it retains its properties and color even with prolonged exposure to sunlight.

  ASA is highly impact-resistant, lightweight, and very strong. These properties make ASA perfect for technical prints that require precision and strength. ASA is printed on a heated build plate, where the temperature should be around  90-110 degreesC for the material to adhere properly to the build plate. We recommend using PrimaFIX or similar to ensure a good result.
