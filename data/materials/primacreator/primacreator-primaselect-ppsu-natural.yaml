  PrimaSELECT Polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) - Amorphous high-performance thermoplastic, better impact strength and chemical resistance than PEI

  PrimaSELECT Polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) is an amorphous high-performance thermoplastic that offers better impact and chemical resistance than PEI. PPSU can be used at temperatures up to 180 C. Compared to other amorphous thermoplastics, PPSU has superior hydrolysis resistance. Measured in steam autoclave cycles, it is steam sterilizable virtually indefinitely. It is also resistant to common acids and bases over a wide temperature range.
  Material properties PrimaSELECTTM PPSU Polyphenylsulfone (PPSU):

      Better impact strength and chemical resistance than PEI
      Superior hydrolysis resistance
      Virtually unlimited steam sterilizability
      Resistant to acids and bases over a wide temperature range
      Applications in aerospace, automotive, dentistry & other medical applications

  PPSU filament meets medical applications & European standards

  The PPSU filament manufactured by PrimaCreator meets ISO10993 for medical applications and complies with European regulations EC No. 1935/2004, EC No. 2023/2006 and EC No. 10/2011 on plastic food contact materials and articles and is also compliant with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for food contact. The dyes used by PrimaCreator to colour the filament also comply with these European regulations.
  Polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) Applications:

      Aerospace
      Automotive industry
      Dentistry
      Medical and surgical instruments

  Highest quality standards in the production of PPSU

  The PrimaCreator PPSU filament has unique properties because it does not come into contact with water during the production process and is packed directly in a vacuum package. These material properties make the PrimaCreator PPSU filament particularly suitable for use in FDM and FFF 3D printers. The material has excellent adhesion between layers, which leads to a great improvement in impact resistance, strength and durability. It ensures an easy 3D printing process. The PPSU filament is based on Solvay's technology.
  For a successful PPSU 3D print these things have to be considered

  The 3D printer must have the ability to manufacture PPSU filament and it should be 3D printed with a nozzle temperature of 360 - 400 degreesC. The heating bed should be set to 140 degreesC or higher. A heated build chamber is hugely important. It is also important that the 3D printer is located in a room where there are hardly any draughts and temperature fluctuations.
