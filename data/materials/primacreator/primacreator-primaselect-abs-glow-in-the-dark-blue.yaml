      Fast printing: Optimized to meet the demands for high print speeds, saving valuable time without compromising quality.
      Reduced odor issues: Our Select series ABS reduces unpleasant odors compared to cheaper alternatives, creating a more pleasant working environment. However, we recommend using it in well-ventilated spaces for the best experience.

  ABS is highly impact-resistant, lightweight, and very strong. These properties make ABS perfect for technical prints that require precision and strength. ABS is printed on a heated build plate, where the temperature should be around  90-110 degreesC for the material to adhere properly to the build plate. We recommend using PrimaFIX or similar to ensure a good result.
