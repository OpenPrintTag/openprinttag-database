  Water-soluble support filament PrimaSELECT PVA HT

  PrimaSELECT PVA HT (polyvinyl alcohol) is a water-soluble material thats most often used as a support material. PVA 3D prints translucent with a slightly yellow tint. It is most often used on 3D printers with dual extruders, with one extruder printing a primary material (such as ABS or PLA) and the other printing this easily dissolved material to provide support for overhanging features.
  Key material features PrimaSELECT PVA HT:

      Support filament for dual extruder 3D printing
      Water-soluble material
      Suitable for high temperature materials like ABS, ASA, TPUs and more
      Meets highest quality standards

  Use PVA HT with high-temperature materials

  PrimaSELECT PVA HT 3D prints with a higher 3D printer temperature than our PVA+. This makes it suitable for materials like ABS, ASA, TPUs and other high temp printer materials. It also works good in 3D printers with heated chambers.
  Support material for ABS & PETG

  PrimaSELECT PVA HT is the perfect support material for ABS and PETG due to that it is soluble in water. With this material you can make very complexed prints, for example if you need a print that should be hollow. Print with dual extruders and then just put the finished print in water and watch the support material dissolve.
  Dissolve PVA HT

  For best results use lukewarm water for dissolving and with circulation of the water.
  Use it with a heated bed

  When printing with PrimaSELECT PVA HT we recommend that you use a heated bed. Set your heat bed to  80-90C for best results.

  PrimaSELECT PVA HT sticks on BuildTak or glass plate coated with adhesive spray or glue stick.

  PrimaSELECT PVA HT is reeled on a transparent spool with 500 g of high-quality filament. Its packed in a sturdy box and packed with silica gel to avoid moister.

  PrimaSELECT PVA HT is available in diameter sizes of 1.75 mm and 2.85 mm.

  Our state-of-the-art factory is equipped with the latest in laser measuring technology to ensure that you will receive a spool of filament with a very tight diameter and roundness tolerance. This in turn makes for a filament that is compatible with most common printers on the market today.
