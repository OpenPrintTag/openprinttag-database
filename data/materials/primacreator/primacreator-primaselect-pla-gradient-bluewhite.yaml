  More Environmentally Friendly

  Our new generation of PLA is developed with the environment in mind. Made from renewable resources, this filament is a more sustainable choice compared to traditional plastic materials. You can feel confident that you're making a better choice for both yourself and the planet.
  No Toxic Fumes

  One of the greatest advantages of PrimaSELECT PLA is that it does not emit any toxic fumes during printing. This makes it ideal for indoor use, whether you're creating at home, in school, or at the office. You get a safe and comfortable printing experience every time.
  Easy to Use

  PrimaSELECT PLA is known for its ease of handling. It does not require a heated build plate, although you will achieve the best results when the plate is set to 45-55 degrees Celsius. To ensure a flawless print, we recommend using PrimaFIX, which improves adhesion and provides a smooth and even surface. It also helps to easily remove the finished print.
  Strength and Durability

  While not as strong as other materials such as ABS or PETG, PLA offers adequate strength and durability for many decorative and functional applications, especially those where the finish is more important than mechanical strength.
  High Quality

  Made with carefully selected raw materials, PrimaSELECT PLA guarantees a smooth and reliable printing process every time. You get precision and reliability in every print, saving you time and frustration.

  SELECT PLA is available in Sparkle, Satin, Pastel, Matt, Marble, Metal Shine, Gradient, and Glow.
