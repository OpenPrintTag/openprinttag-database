  PrimaSelect NylonPower Glass Fiber - The latest high-performance filament for your 3D printer

  PrimaSelect NylonPower Glass Fiber is the latest high-performance filament for your 3D printer. The 3D printing material is based on Nylon 12 and is 16 % glass fiber reinforced. This composition results in an optimally resistant filament. Nylon glass filament is perfect for additive manufacturing of components for the automotive industry, drone construction and RC parts.

  Main material properties NylonPower fiber reinforced PA12:

      High chemical and thermal resistance
      Excellent surface quality
      Minimized warping tendency compared to conventional nylon
      Easy to process

  3D prints very strong parts of NylonPower and glass fiber

  PrimaSelect NylonPower Glass Fiber is an extremely useful material with unique material properties. In this filament, the nylon is reinforced with small, cut-glass fiber strands. PrimaSelect NylonPower Filament offers you incredible stiffness, structure, and excellent layer adhesion.
  Simply process the NylonPower filament with glass

  Furthermore, NylonPower is very easy to process and has a matt surface. The perfect 3D prints are very stiff, rigid, and ideal if you need an object with a high stiffness/weight ratio. To process PrimaSelect NylonPower Filament, use a heated printing bed - set to 60 C - to achieve good adhesion of the first layer to the building platform.
  Process NylonPower Glass Fibre with a Steel Nozzle

  Because of the highly abrasive properties of PrimaSelect NylonPower (the nozzle wears quickly due to abrasion), we recommend that you use a hardened steel nozzle for this filament. Using a normal brass nozzle is not a problem, but the nozzle will wear out in a short time.PrimaSelect NylonPower adheres to glass coated with adhesive spray or adhesive.
  Material properties of Nylon Glass Fibre filament:

      Weight and spool: Each spool comes with 500 grams of high quality filament. NylonPower is supplied packed on a clear spool with a strong desiccant to avoid moisture
      Perfect diameter tolerance:NylonPower filament is controlled throughout the whole additive manufacturing process. This ensures that you receive a filament with a diameter tolerance of +/-0.05 mm
      Perfect spooling: We have made great efforts to make every spool of filament perfect. So you can be sure that the filament will not get tangled on the spool
      Easy to 3D print: The glass fibres mixed with nylon make this material very easy to process on most 3D printers. We recommend a hardened nozzle
