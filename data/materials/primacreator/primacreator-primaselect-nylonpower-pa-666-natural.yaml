  Prima SELECT NylonPower PA 6/66 - Buy PA6/66 3D printer filament

  NylonPower PA 6/66 by PrimaCreator is a special co-polymer blend 3D printer Polyamide filament that takes full advantage of the strengths of both PA 6 and PA66. The combination of these two types of polyamides makes our Nylon very easy to 3D print. Normally Nylon (PA) is very hard to 3D print with. With regular nylon 3D printer filaments, you'll have a hard time to make it stick to the build plate. With NylonPower you can use lower 3D printing temperatures than you normally would with Nylon. Use this material in most common FFF/FDM 3D printers.
  Main material properties of NylonPower PA6/66:

      Perfect blend of PA6 and PA66
      High chemical and thermal resistance
      Less warping than regular Nylon makes it easy to 3D print
      Excellent layer adhesion creates strong 3D printed parts

  How to 3D print Nylon filament best

  When 3D printing with Nylon you should do so on a heated build plate. For best adhesion we recommend that you use Magigoo PA. The temperature should be set to 60-80degreesC.
  Nylon PA6/66 a powerful 3D printing filament

  Nylon has strong mechanical strength and deforms less. Its hard to snap of or break. Furthermore, Nylon is also one of the best materials when it comes to impact resistance.
  Special material properties of nylon & tips for process it

  Nylon is very hydroscopic. This means that it absorbs liquids, this could be a benefit if you want to dye your filament. It also means that it is important to dry your Nylon before use. You can set the oven at 70-80degreesC and leave it there for 4-8 hours. The longer you leave it, the dryer it will be. That will also reflect on the finished print result, both visual and performance wise.
