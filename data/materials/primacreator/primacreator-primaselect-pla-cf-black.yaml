  PrimaSelect PLA-CF

  PRIMA SELECT PLA-CF is a specialized 3D printing filament that combines Polylactic Acid (PLA) with carbon fiber (CF) to create a material with enhanced mechanical properties. The addition of carbon fiber significantly improves the strength, rigidity, and overall performance of the filament, making it suitable for demanding applications.
  Material Composition

      PLA Base: Retains the ease of printing and biodegradability of standard PLA.
      10% Carbon Fiber: Infused with 10% carbon fiber, which enhances the filament's properties.

  Enhanced Mechanical Properties:

      Increased Strength and Rigidity: The carbon fibers provide greater tensile strength and stiffness, making parts more durable and resistant to deformation.
      Improved Dimensional Stability: Reduced warping and shrinkage during printing, resulting in more accurate and stable prints.

  Printing Characteristics:

      Ease of Printing: Similar to standard PLA but may require a hardened steel nozzle to prevent wear from the abrasive carbon fibers.
      Surface Finish: Parts printed with PRIMA SELECT PLA-CF often have a matte, slightly textured surface due to the carbon fiber content.

  Applications:

      Functional Prototypes: Ideal for creating strong, lightweight prototypes that need to withstand mechanical stress.
      End-Use Parts: Suitable for manufacturing durable end-use components for various industries.
      Tools and Fixtures: Great for making custom tools and fixtures that require high strength and stiffness.

  Environmental Considerations

  Retains the environmentally friendly aspect of PLA, though the presence of carbon fiber may affect compostability.
  Usage Tips:

      Nozzle Requirements: Use a hardened steel nozzle to prevent excessive wear due to the abrasive nature of carbon fibers.
      Print Settings: Typically prints at temperatures around 210-230degreesC with a bed temperature of 30-60degreesC. Adjust settings based on specific printer and filament manufacturer recommendations.
      Storage: Keep the filament in a cool, dry place to avoid moisture absorption, which can affect print quality.

  PRIMA SELECT PLA-CF is a robust, high-performance filament that combines the ease of use and eco-friendliness of PLA with the enhanced strength and rigidity of carbon fiber. It is ideal for applications that require durable, high-strength parts and offers excellent dimensional stability and a unique surface finish. Suitable for both prototyping and end-use parts, PRIMA SELECT PLA-CF provides a reliable solution for demanding 3D printing projects.
