  Why Choose PrimaSELECT PLA Flame Retardant?

  UL94-V0 is a classification within the UL94 standard, which is a standard for assessing the flammability of plastic materials. It is used to determine how easily a plastic material ignites and how quickly it burns when exposed to a flame.
  What UL94-V0 Means:

      Flame Spread Rating: UL94-V0 is the highest rating in the V series (V-0, V-1, V-2), indicating that the material is very difficult to ignite and quickly self-extinguishes when ignited.
      Test Procedure:The test involves exposing a sample piece of the plastic material to a flame for 10 seconds and then observing how long it takes for the flame to extinguish.
      For UL94-V0, each individual burn time must not exceed 10 seconds after the flame is removed.
      None of the five test samples can have a total burn time exceeding 50 seconds across all tests combined.
      Burning Drips: To meet the UL94-V0 standard, no flaming drips from the sample piece should ignite a cotton pad placed underneath the sample.

  Summary of UL94-V0 Requirements:

      Burn Time per Sample: Maximum 10 seconds.
      Total Burn Time for Five Samples: Maximum 50 seconds.
      Flaming Drips: No drips should ignite cotton underneath the sample during the test.

  Applications:

      Electronics and electrical components.
      Household appliances where plastic parts may be exposed to heat or flame.
      Automotive industry.
      Construction and building materials.

  By using materials that meet the UL94-V0 standard, manufacturers can ensure that their products have a high level of fire safety, reducing the risk of fire-related accidents.
