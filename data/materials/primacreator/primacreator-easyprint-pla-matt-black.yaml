  With EasyPrint Matt PLA your prints will look more beautiful than ever!

  EasyPrint Matt PLA is our latest PLA and is made from 100% virgin PLA pellets. Matt PLA is one of the most versatile and easy to use filaments on the market. With the right settings you can print parts that is very strong, and it also have a nice matt surface and a slight rough surface which gives it a very natural look. Matt PLAhas a rough surface which gives it a more natural look when printed. It also has the benefit of higher prints speeds than regular PLA. This version of PLA is perfect when you dont want shiny prints but rather have the matt surface without any reflections. Its perfect for architects and model makers that dont want that plastic feeling. Thanks to the very low shrinkageEasyPrint Matt PLAis very easy to use in all FDM/FFF printers. The risk of warping is very small withEasyPrint Matt PLAand it works well without a heated build plate, but for larger prints and the absolute best results we recommend a heated build plate. A temperature setting of 40-60degreesC, will make the prints stick even better.
  Wide Temperature span
