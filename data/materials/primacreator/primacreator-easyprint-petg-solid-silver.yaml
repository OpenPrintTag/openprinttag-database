  Material properties of EasyPrint PETG filament:

  High quality EasyPrint PETG filament for your 3D printer
  Material properties of EasyPrint PETG filament:

      Achieve impressive surfaces with a noble look - depending on colour or wall thickness
      The filament is transparent or slightly translucent
      Very versatile & easy to use
      EasyPrint PETG filament is easy to process in a wide temperature range
      High material quality and perfect spooling of the material on each roll

  Transparent and coloured PETG filament

  With the transparent & coloured PETG filament you get high gloss and, depending on the wall thickness and colour, almost completely transparent 3D prints. The solid colours offer a vivid and beautiful surface with a noble high gloss finish.
  PETG = PET + Glycol

  EasyPrint PETG filament is made from PET treated with glycols. This makes the super PETG filament even clearer, stronger and more resistant than filament made from normal PET.
  Good layer adhesion & low warping

  This PETG filament is characterised by very good adhesion between layers. This and its low warping tendency make it very easy to process. If you have a 3D printer with a heatable build platform, we recommend a temperature setting of 40-60 degreesC.
  3D print packaging, objects and parts in top quality

  Without a doubt, EasyPrint PETG is one of the best filaments for your 3D printer. 3D print packaging, objects and components with excellent quality and a noble surface. The filament is quality controlled throughout the entire manufacturing process. This ensures that you receive a perfect filament spool with every order. Additively produce objects with excellent quality and a noble surface.
  3D print PETG in a wide temperature range

  3D print PETG in a very wide temperature range thanks to high material quality and purity of additives. The recommended extruder temperature is between 210 - 235 degrees C.
  Perfectly wound filament spools

  From your first glance at Easy Print PETG filament, you will notice the perfectly wound spools. Each web and layer is perfectly wound with no overlap or crossover with the previous web or layer. This ensures that the material does not get knotted and tangled. 3D print free from problems caused by material tangling, even with very long and large components. During the manufacturing process, the filament is constantly laser measured to ensure that we maintain a cross-section tolerance of +/- 0.02 mm.
  Overview thanks to easy-to-understand length display

  Every EasyPrint PETG spool has an intelligent filament length indicator. Keep track of how much filament is left on your roll in a simple and clear way. This way you always know if you can still produce your object with the inserted spool or if you must change the roll.
  Easy 3D printing with stunning surfaces & material properties

  Buy now the high quality EasyPrint PETG filament at a very good price. Easily realize 3D, art, design objects and components with stunning surfaces and amazing material properties.
