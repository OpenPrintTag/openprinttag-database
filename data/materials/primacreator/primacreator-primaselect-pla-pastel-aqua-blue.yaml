  Easy to Use

  PrimaSELECT PLA is known for its ease of handling. It does not require a heated build plate, although you will achieve the best results when the plate is set to 45-55 degrees Celsius. To ensure a flawless print, we recommend using PrimaFIX, which improves adhesion and provides a smooth and even surface. It also helps to easily remove the finished print.

  While not as strong as other materials such as ABS or PETG, PLA offers adequate strength and durability for many decorative and functional applications, especially those where the finish is more important than mechanical strength.
