  PrimaSELECT Ultem 9085 - Buy Polyether Imide (PEI) 3D printer filament

  PrimaSELECT Polyether Imide (PEI) Ultem 9085 is an amorphous, high-performance thermoplastics with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 186 degreesC. This material features superior mechanical performance, flame retardancy (UL 94-VO rated) and strength-to-weight ratio.
  Material properties PrimaSELECTTM Ultem 9085:

      Polyether Imide (PEI) 3D printer filament
      High-performance thermoplastics
      Excellent strength-to-weight ratio
      Superior mechanical performance
      Flame retardancy (UL 94-VO rated)
      Glass transition temperature (Tg) of 186 degreesC

  PrimaSELECT Ultem 9085 filament offers high impact resistance, strength and durability

  PrimaSELECT PEI Filament has unique properties because it does not come into contact with water during the production process and is directly packaged in a vacuum packaging. These properties make the PrimaCreator PEI Filament particularly suitable for usage in FDM and FFF 3D printers. The 3D printing Ultem material has an excellent adhesion between layers which results in great improvement of the impact resistance, strength and durability. It offers you high performance during the whole 3D printing process.
  3D print PEI Ultem filament successfully

  To make a successful PEI 3D print there are a few things to keep in mind. Your 3D printer must have the performance to meet the PEI filament demands. The material should be 3D printed with a nozzle temperature of 355-390degreesC. The heat bed should be set to 120-160degreesC and a heated chamber is important to have. Also ensure that your 3D printer is placed in a room where theres hardly any draft and temperature fluctuations.
  Good adhesion PEI to the build platform

  PEI is best printed on a PEI sheet at a printing speed of 15-30 mm/s.
