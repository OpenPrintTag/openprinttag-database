  PEI Filament - High manufacturing quality

  The PrimaCreator PEI Filament has unique properties because it does not come into contact with water during the production process and is directly packaged in a vacuum packaging. These properties make the PrimaCreator PEI Filament particularly suitable for usage in FDM and FFF 3D printers. The material has an excellent adhesion between layers which results in great improvement of the impact resistance, strength, durability and the printing process.
  To make a successful PEI print there are a few things to keep in mind

  The printer must have the performance to meet the PEI filament and it should be printed with a nozzle temperature of 350-380degreesC. The heat bed should be set to 120-160degreesC and a heated chamber is important to have. Its also very important to make sure that the printer is placed in a room where theres hardly any draft and temperature fluctuations.PEEK is best printed on a PEI sheet at a printing speed of 15-30 mm/s.
