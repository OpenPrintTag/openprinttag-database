  ASA is highly impact-resistant, lightweight, and very strong. These properties make ASA perfect for technical prints that require precision and strength. ASA is printed on a heated build plate, where the temperature should be around  90-110 degreesC for the material to adhere properly to the build plate. We recommend using PrimaFIX or similar to ensure a good result.
