  Excellent durability, strength and flexibility

  Spectrum PET-G FX120™ is a flexible material, designed especially for engineering applications requiring both the durability of an engineering-class polymer and strength, enabling designers to create rapidly truly functional parts to withstand normal use.

  Parts made of Spectrum PET-G FX120™ filament exhibit high chemical resistance, temperature resistance, and can be steam sterilized. The material is adapted to the use of a high level of cooling rate, which makes it possible to obtain a very high-quality surface and a significant reduction of filament stringing. Spectrum PET-G FX120™ can be printed with increased operating speeds, as compared to other elastomers.

  Spectrum PET-G FX120™ belongs to the group of rigid elastomers. As a result, it can be effectively used on devices with a Bowden filament feeding mechanism, as well as in more and more popular multi-material printers – then it can be perfectly combined with the classic PET-G filament. The additives used in the development of this material significantly increased the maximum operating temperature – even up to 120°C.

  Tip: It is recommended to print using a heated chamber.
