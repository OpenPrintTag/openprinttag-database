  Durability of PCTG enhanced by the advantages of glass fibre

  The potential of high-impact PCTG inspired us to develop another composite based on this copolyester – Spectrum PCTG GF10. The use of glass fibre filling has resulted in a high-strength filament with an intriguingly matt surface.

  When creating the composition, we paid particular attention to reducing the abrasiveness of the glass fibres, which is typical for this type of filling. For this reason, we used functionalised glass fibres with a less aggressive geometry, reducing degradation of the printer nozzle.

  Spectrum PCTG GF10 is a technical filament with high stiffness and hardness. Thanks to its extremely high interlayer adhesion and low shrinkage, it allows even intermediate users to execute large prints.

  In addition, the glass fibres give the prints a distinctive texture, which, in addition to its undoubted aesthetic qualities, also translates into increased usability. Models made from Spectrum PCTG GF10 can be used wherever increased adhesion, increased durability against cyclic load and chemical resistance are important.
