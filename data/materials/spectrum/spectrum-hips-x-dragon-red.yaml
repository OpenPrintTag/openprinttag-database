  High impact resistance

  Spectrum HIPS?X is a backing material designed for additive manufacturing using FDM/FFF technology. It is usually used as a substrate for components produced with ABS, where HIPS-X substrates are dissolved in D-Limonene at the end of the production process. In addition, Spectrum HIPS-X can be used as a base material for the production of components that require less processing shrinkage than ABS.

  Spectrum HIPS-X exhibits high impact and compressive strength. It also allows for opaque surfaces with reduced layer visibility. Like ABS, HIPS-X allows for mechanical processing such as grinding, turning, milling, etc. The low hardness of molded items allows sections of the material to be easily separated with sharp tools.

  Primarily used as a support material, Spectrum HIPS?X is also designed for industrial applications that require components that are impact resistant or can partially dissipate energy. Due to its low hardness, HIPS-X can be used in the arts, particularly in sculpture.
