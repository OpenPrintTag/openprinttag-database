  Professional halogen-free 3D printing filament

  PC/ABS FR V0 filament is a professional, halogen-free filament for 3D printers. It is designed to meet UL-94 V0 flammability standards, meaning it is self-extinguishing and meets the highest fire safety standards.

  The filament features a high-gloss surface, making prints aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing. One of the features of this filament is the absence of halogen in the composition, which means that it does not contain harmful chemicals such as bromine or chlorine.

  PC/ABS FR V0 is distinguished by its excellent interlayer adhesion, which is crucial for durable and precise prints. As a result, you can create intricate models and components with the confidence that they will be robust and durable.

  The composition used for the PC/ABS FR V0 filament contains a high percentage of PC, ABS and halogen-free flame retardant modifiers. Thanks to the flame retardant modifiers used, the filament can be printed at relatively low temperatures, comparable to printing with ABS.

  PC/ABS FR V0 is ideal for designers and creatives who require durable prints with exceptional self-extinguishing properties.
