description: |+
  Introducing the new Spectrum FlameGuard PLA filament, based on an innovative formula designed for applications that require both durability and fire safety. FlameGuard PLA is a halogen-free, flame-retardant material that meets the highest V0 fire safety standards, making it the perfect choice for advanced applications such as electronics enclosures, automation device components, furniture finishes, and speaker housings.

  FlameGuard PLA is an eco-friendly alternative to standard FR ABS, which contains halogens. Halogens limit the recyclability of the material, often leading to landfill waste, whereas our filament promotes a sustainable approach, offering recyclability and reduced environmental impact. Compared to traditional FR ABS, FlameGuard PLA boasts a carbon footprint (PCF) that is up to seven times lower – typically 0.6 kgCO2e/kg for PLA based material versus typically 3.8 kgCO2e/kg for ABS FR, while maintaining similar physical properties such as modulus of elasticity and tensile strength.

  FlameGuard PLA is an innovative material with a high content of renewable resources, providing durability comparable to FR ABS while meeting V0 UL94 flame retardancy standards. It offers safety, ecological responsibility, and high quality in a single solution.
