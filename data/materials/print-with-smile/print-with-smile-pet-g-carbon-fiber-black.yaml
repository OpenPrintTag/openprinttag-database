description: |2
   PETG CARBON FIBER is an extremely durable material. Prints made of PET-G + CF shrink very little, are odorless and have very strong interlayer bonds. The material is characterized by a graphite, matte surface and a smooth to satin structure and is relatively easy to print. Minimal shrinkage during printing allows you to print in an open device. This material retains the excellent printing properties typical of PET-G and at the same time its mechanical and temperature resistance is increased. The stability and ease of printing make this material great for printing mechanically stressed parts where additional surface treatments are needed. It is suitable for printing structural elements, also because it is resistant to high temperatures. Another advantage in printing is high rigidity, excellent surface quality and dimensional stability. PET-G + CF has increased mechanical, thermal and impact strength due to the addition of carbon fibers, which makes the filament universally applicable.
