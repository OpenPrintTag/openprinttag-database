description: |-
  PA12 - CF15 is an innovative 3D printing filament that combines the properties of PA12 material with the added properties of carbon fiber.

  This filament is made of PA12 (nylon 12), which is a highly durable and strong thermoplastic material that is widely used in industry. PA12 3D filament provides good dimensional stability. The addition of carbon fiber to the PA12 filament increases its mechanical properties and strength. Carbon fiber provides higher rigidity to the material, making it a suitable choice for applications requiring durability and strength, such as functional prototypes, industrial parts or tools.

  PA12 - CF15 is also resistant to high temperatures and has excellent chemical resistance, making it an ideal material for demanding industrial applications. In addition, carbon fiber adds lightness to the filament and improves its resistance to wear and friction. This filament is compatible with most commonly available 3D printers that support printing with PA12 materials.

  It is recommended to use higher print temperatures and the use of a hardened nozzle to minimize nozzle wear. It is recommended to print in the heating chamber.

  PA12 3D filament - CF15 is an excellent material for those looking for a combination of PA12 properties and added strength and durability thanks to carbon fiber. Its applications are diverse and include industrial applications such as spare parts, tools, models and functional prototypes that require high mechanical stability and durability in harsh conditions.
