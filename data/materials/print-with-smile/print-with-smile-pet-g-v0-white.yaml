description: |-
  Modified with polyethylene terephthalate glycol - PET-G V0 is an amorphous thermoplastic copolyester with a flame retardant, which is characterized by excellent strength and optical properties. Thanks to the V0 loading, it is suitable for printing electronic components. PET-G filament is designed primarily for professional 3D prints with FDM technology. It‘s more flexible and softer than PLA or ABS filaments. It has very low shrinkage and excellent layer adhesion, making it suitable for large-area 3D prints. PET-G is highly chemically resistant to acids and produces no unpleasant odour during printing. That's why 3D printing with PET-G is so enjoyable! Another indisputable advantage of this filament is its recyclability.

  PROPERITIES

      Excellent adhesion between layers
      Material for advanced users
      Glossy print surface
      Slight effect of flossing (dental floss)
      High accuracy of printed part dimensions
      High transparency
      High mechanical strength
