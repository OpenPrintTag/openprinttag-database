description: |-
  RE-PETG is a 3D filament made from recycled PETG, which is an amorphous thermoplastic copolyester that has excellent strength and optical properties.

  RE-PETG is an amorphous thermoplastic copolyester that has excellent strength and optical properties. RE-PETG filament is designed for professional 3D prints with FDM technology. It‘s more flexible and softer than PLA or ABS filaments. It has very low shrinkage and excellent layer adhesion, making it suitable for large-area 3D prints. RE-PETG is highly chemically resistant to acids and produces no unpleasant odour during printing.

  PROPERITIES

      Excellent adhesion between layers
      Material for advanced users
      Glossy print surface
      Slight effect of flossing (Strings)
      High accuracy of printed part dimensions
      High transparency
      High mechanical strength
