description: |-
  PLA UHT C15 is an innovative 3D printing filament that combines the advantages of PLA material with the added properties of carbon fiber.

  This filament is made of PLA (polylactic acid), which is biodegradable and obtained from renewable resources. Thanks to the addition of carbon fiber, PLA UHT C15 gains higher strength and rigidity, making it an ideal material for applications requiring durability and mechanical stability. Carbon fibers increase heat resistance, allowing you to print with PLA HT C15 even at higher temperatures without deformation.

  The PLA UHT C15 filament also has excellent UV resistance, making it a suitable choice for outdoor applications or for creating functional prototypes to be exposed to sunlight. In addition, carbon fiber increases resistance to cracking and prevents deformation during thermal changes.

  Overall, the PLA UHT C15 3D filament is an excellent material for those looking for a combination of PLA properties and added strength and durability thanks to carbon fiber. Its use is wide and includes industrial prototypes, engineering parts, models, and other applications that require high durability and mechanical stability.

  When PLA UHT C15 is thermally annealed, the printout shrinks. The approximate shrinkage of the PAL UHT C15 3D filament is 1% on the X,Y axes and 0.6% on the Z-axis.

  Thermal annealing is a process in which a print is subjected to elevated temperatures in order to achieve further improvement in its mechanical properties. Thermal annealing releases internal tensions in the printout, which can lead to dimensional changes. To minimize shrinkage of the print during thermal annealing of PLA HT C15, it is recommended to observe the following procedures:

  1. Correct temperature setting: Annealing should take place at the optimum temperature of 80 - 100 ° C for 30 - 60 min (depending on the size of the model). When thermal annealing, it is advisable to gradually increase the temperature to adapt the print to thermal changes gradually and minimize shrinkage. We recommend annealing the model on a print bed.

  2. Use of support structures: When printing a model that will then be annealed, it is advisable to use support structures that minimize the internal stress in the printout and reduce the risk of shrinkage.

  3. Annealing in a suitable environment: It is recommended to perform annealing in a stable and heated environment that minimizes the influence of ambient temperature on the print.

  It is important to note that shrinkage rates can be affected by various factors, including model geometry, temperature, annealing length, and other variables. Experimenting and gradually improving the annealing process is therefore important to achieve the best results with PLA UHT C15. This filament is compatible with most commonly available 3D printers that support printing with PLA materials. It is recommended to use a hardened nozzle.
