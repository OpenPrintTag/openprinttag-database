description: |+
  PET-G is an amorphous thermoplastic copolyester that has excellent strength and optical properties.

  Modified polyethylene terephthalate glycol - PET-G is an amorphous thermoplastic copolyester that has excellent strength and optical properties. PET-G filament is designed primarily for professional 3D prints with FDM technology. It‘s more flexible and softer than PLA or ABS filaments. It has very low shrinkage and excellent layer adhesion, making it suitable for large-area 3D prints. PET-G is highly chemically resistant to acids and produces no unpleasant odour during printing. That's why 3D printing with PET-G is so enjoyable! Another indisputable advantage of this filament is its recyclability.

  PROPERITIES

      - Excellent adhesion between layers
      - Material for advanced users
      - Glossy print surface
      - Slight effect of flossing (stringing)
      - High accuracy of printed part dimensions
      - High transparency
      - High mechanical strength
