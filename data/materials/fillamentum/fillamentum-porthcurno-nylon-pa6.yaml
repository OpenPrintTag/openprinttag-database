  Introducing Fishy Filaments by Fillamentum "Porthcurno" - 3D printing filament Nylon (PA6) that is made from upcycled and recycled fishing nets. Porthcurno is a sustainable and eco-friendly option for 3D printing, as it reduces waste. It has a unique slightly translucent appearance that resembles the sea. Porthcurno is best suited for artistic and decorative 3D printing projects, as its unique appearance makes it a great choice for creating intricate and visually interesting designs. It can also be used for functional models that have excellent mechanical and chemical resistance.


   Key Feature

      100% recycled material from fishing nets
      Smooth and shiny finish
      Unique slightly translucent look reminiscent of the sea
      Excellent mechanical resistance
      Exceptional temperature resistance up to 180 degreesC
      High tensile strength also at high temperatures
      High impact resistance is preserved also under low temperatures (at -20 degreesC)
      Safe to use in electrical and electronic equipment
      Possibility of sterilization in the autoclave
      Recyclable
