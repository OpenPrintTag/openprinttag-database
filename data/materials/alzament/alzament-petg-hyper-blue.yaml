description: |-


  The Alzament filament is a refill for 3D printers. It is designed with the ideal parameters for the perfect printing of every detail. You are sure to appreciate its quality and the lack of an unpleasant smell. The Blue colour of this 3D printer filament will keep for a very long time. Its weight is equal to about 1 kg. The nozzle temperature may reach 250 °C while the printing takes place, and the temperature of the pad should be set to 120 °C. The Alzament filament is made of PETG. This is an improvement on PET. It has modified glycol, so it is more resistant to shocks and vibrations. The diameter of the string is 1,75 mm, and the tolerance of the diameter is 0,02 mm.
