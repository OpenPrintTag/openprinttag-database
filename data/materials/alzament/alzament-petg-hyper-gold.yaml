  The Alzament filament is designed as a refill for 3D printers. It has the perfect properties for the exact printing of every detail. Customers will love its precision and quality and the lack of the unpleasant smell typical of such filaments. The Gold colour of this 3D printer filament will keep for a long time after the printing process. Its weight is equal to about 1 kg. The nozzle temperature may reach 250 °C while the printing takes place. The temperature of the pad should be 120 °C. The Alzament filament is made of PETG.
