      Genuine wooden finish
      Woody scent
      Easy to use

  Our PLA Wood is a blend that contains 40% wood fibres and 60% biobased PLA. The finished print smells, feels and looks like wood, and is very easy to post-process with a fine sandpaper for excellent results. You might get the feeling that you enter a wood workshop instead of your printer room while printing this material. Made in Sweden, it is one of the most sustainable filaments out there.

  PLA Wood is super easy to print and there is almost no shrinkage at all, so no need for extra bed adhesion. There is also no requirement for any special nozzle, it works just fine in a standard brass nozzle.

  Just remember, PLA Wood absorbs moisture easily because of its fiber content. To prevent problems like stringing and oozing, use a filament dryer before and during printing. This helps maintain a smoother surface finish and better layer adhesion.

  Please see our print guide for further instructions.
