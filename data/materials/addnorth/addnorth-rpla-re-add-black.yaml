      100% Recycled 3D-waste
      Community based product
      Circular waste stream

  Thank you for your support! The creation of rPLA RE-ADD has been made possible thanks to our dedicated customers. This exceptional filament results from the blend of customer 3D-waste and filament waste from our own production, along with a proprietary mixture, skillfully restoring the distinct qualities of pristine PLA.

  rPLA RE-ADD is colored black, but there are slight color differences in each batch.

  The availability of this circular filament is closely tied to the amount of 3D-waste we receive from our valued community. Your ongoing efforts in returning your cherished Benchys, adorable Groots, and beloved Baby Yodas play a crucial role in ensuring its continuous availability.

  We greatly appreciate your partnership on this eco-conscious journey. By collaboratively transforming discarded materials into renewed possibilities, we're collectively building a more sustainable future. Keep up the commendable work, and let's continue reshaping the world of 3D printing for the better!
