      High impact resistance PLA
      100% biodegradable
      Unique surface finish (hides layer lines)

  X-PLA is a unique PLA-mix developed by Add north. It's produced using 100% biodegradable material and has a high impact resistance, zero brittleness and an unbeatable surface finish. X-PLA was first developed to meet the high requirements from architects, who often print thin walls but at the same time want a resistive and even surface finish.

  X-PLA is just as easy to print with as regular PLA and has a solid and robust feeling which is perfect for technical applications but also prototypes and figures. X-PLA can be printed at low temperatures (from 180 degreesC) and will get a beautiful matte finish that is not possible using regular PLA.

  For additional printing advice, check out our cheat sheets for recommended slicer settings in Cura, Simplify 3D and PrusaSlicer.

  Add North's X-PLA, together with all our other filaments, are made in Sweden and have a diameter tolerance of 0.025mm.

  X-PLA is available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm diameter with large spool sizes up to 5,000g. (Colors found on large spool sizes are: white, light grey and black)
