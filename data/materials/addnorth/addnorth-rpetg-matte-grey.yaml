      Recycled PETG, made from bottles and plastic packaging
      Prints like regular PETG
      Matte surface finish 

  Our rPETG is made from recycled bottles and plastic packaging. The waste has first been cleaned and upcycled in order to hold the quality standard that you expect from filaments from add:north. In addition to being recycled we also made the material matte in order for you to make your prints stand out even more.

  PETG has grown to be one of the most popular materials for many users. It has in many ways replaced ABS as the primary material for technical applications mainly because of its chemical resistance. PETG is highly suitable for functional parts thanks to a working temperature of up to 75degreesC, together with high wear resistance, excellent UV-properties and chemical resistance.
