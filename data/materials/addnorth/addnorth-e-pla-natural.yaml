      Easy to print PLA
      Wide selection of colors
      Glitter and fluorescent effects

  E-PLA is made of biodegradable bioplastics, PLA. It's a filament that we highly recommend for beginners, because of its ease-of-use and trouble-free printing experience. E-PLA is also a very popular material for prototyping and covers a wide range of needs for the hobbyist. 

  You can print functional parts for indoor use with E-PLA, but be aware of its low wear resistance and don't exceed a working temperature of 60degreesC. 

  The colors are rich, and our glitz-series gives a gorgeous glitter effect to the printed surface. Lucent pink and orange become fluorescent under a black light and we also offer a green glow in the dark color (which you need a abrasion-resistant nozzle to print with, such as Brozzl Hardened steel nozzle). 

  For additional printing advice, check out our cheat sheets for recommended slicer settings in Cura, Simplify 3D and PrusaSlicer.

  Our E-PLA, together with all our other filaments, are made in Sweden and have a diameter tolerance of 0.025mm.

  E-PLA is available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm diameter with large spool sizes up to 2300g. (Colors found on 2,300g spools are: white, light grey and black)
