      Filament that hides layer lines
      Glitter effects with unique surface
      Biobased PLA with plant fibers

  Add:North's TexturaTM Flare is a unique matte bio-based PLA with plant fibers and glitter effects that provide stunning looking 3D-prints. The fibers help hide the layer lines who become barely visible. TexturaTM Flare was first developed towards architects because of its paper-like and unique surface finish, but any maker could benefit from this highly visual material. 3d-print gorgeous looking ornaments, jewelry or any other high visual models with this filament.

  TexturaTM Flare prints just as easy as regular PLA. It's easy to post-process and most types of glues and paints adhere to the surface. (No need for abrasion-resistant nozzles.)

  Just remember, TexturaTM Flare absorbs moisture easily because of its fiber content. To prevent problems like stringing and oozing, use a filament dryer before and during printing. This helps maintain a smoother surface finish and better layer adhesion.

  For additional printing advice, check out our cheat sheets for recommended slicer settings in Cura, Simplify 3D and PrusaSlicer.

  Our TexturaTM Flare, together with all our other filaments, are made in Sweden and have a diameter tolerance of 0.025mm.

  TexturaTM Flare is available on 750g spools in 1.75mm.
