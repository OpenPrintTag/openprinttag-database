      High impact resistance
      Perfect for outdoor use
      3D-print functional parts

  Add Norths PETG prints easily, is odorless, has low warping and a high impact resistance.

  PETG has grown to be one of the most popular materials for many users. It has in many ways replaced ABS as the primary material for technical applications mainly because of its chemical resistance. PETG is highly suitable for functional parts thanks to a working temperature of up to 75degreesC, together with high wear resistance, excellent UV-properties and chemical resistance.

  PETG also has the highest transparency among all our filaments and are available in a number of different colors. Our glitz-series gives a gorgeous glitter effect to the printed surface. We also offer lucent orange, that becomes fluorescent under a black light.

  For additional printing advice, check out our cheat sheets for recommended slicer settings in Cura, Simplify 3D and PrusaSlicer.

  Our PETG, together with all our other filaments, are made in Sweden and have a diameter tolerance of 0.025mm.

  Add North's PETG is available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm diameter with large spool sizes up to 5,000g. (Colors found on larger spool sizes are: white, light grey and black)
