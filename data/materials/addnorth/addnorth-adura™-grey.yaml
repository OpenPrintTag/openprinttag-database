      Easy to print nylon filament
      Optimal for high-strength and functional 3D-printed parts
      Supreme layer bonding filament

  AduraTM is a high-performance Nylon filament made from co-polyamide with high printability, low shrinkage and extreme toughness.

  This material is excellent for high-strength, functional 3D-printed parts. It has superior strength and physical attributes when compared to consumer-grade materials, which makes it the preferred choice for many industrial applications.

  AduraTM's very low shrinkage allows for printing with very tight tolerances and accuracy. The excellent layer bonding, medium flexibility and good chemical and heat resistance makes it a very useful material for demanding applications.

  For additional printing advice, check out our cheat sheets for recommended slicer settings in Cura, Simplify 3D and PrusaSlicer.

  AduraTM, together with all our other filaments, are made in Sweden and have a diameter tolerance of 0.025mm.

  AduraTM is available in 500g spool sizes in 1.75mm and 2.85mm diameter.
