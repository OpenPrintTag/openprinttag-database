      Made of 100% PVDF
      Ideal industrial-grade 3D-printing material
      Extreme layer adhesion and high working temperature

  Add North's Adamant S1 is made of 100% PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride), which makes it the ideal industrial-grade printing material. The Adamant S1 offers good thermal and excellent chemical and solvent resistance. While other PVDF filaments experience a lot of warping, this version is completely warp-free which makes it much easier to use.

  This filament can be used in demanding applications and under some of the most extreme conditions in very harsh environments, with a flammability rating of UL94 V-0.

  Adamant S1 yields semi-flexible prints with extreme durability. Layer adhesion is especially good. Some have called it the low-temp equivalent to PEEK, and it works on almost any regular desktop 3D-printer.

  For additional printing advice, check out our cheat sheets for recommended slicer settings in Cura, Simplify 3D and PrusaSlicer.

  Adamant S1, together with all our other filaments, are made in Sweden and have a diameter tolerance of 0.025mm.

  Adamant S1 is available in 1,000g spool sizes in 1.75mm and 2.85mm diameter.
