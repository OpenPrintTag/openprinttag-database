      Carbon fiber-reinforced Nylon
      Strong prints for high performance environments
      Unique surface finish (hides layer lines)

  Add North's AduraTM X is a carbon fiber reinforced Nylon filament that's extremely tough in several aspects. It's highly wear, chemical and UV-resistant with a working temperature of up to 110degreesC. Layer adhesion is excellent, making this filament highly suited for advanced technical applications.

  AduraTM X is a popular filament amongst manufacturers and is often used for 3D-printing end use parts. Except excellent material properties, AduraTM X provides a surface finish that's second to none - you have to inspect the part closely to notice that it's 3D-printed.

  The carbon fibers make AduraTM X stiffer and less prone to shrinkage, but it is still not too stiff in order to maintain Nylon's extreme impact resistance and part of its flexibility. It's a highly abrasive filament that requires a hardened steel nozzle or equivalent. Nozzle X works very well for printing all our abrasive filaments.

  For additional printing advice, check out our cheat sheets for recommended slicer settings in Cura, Simplify 3D and PrusaSlicer.

  AduraTM X, together with all our other filaments, are made in Sweden and have a diameter tolerance of 0.025mm.

  AduraTM X is available in 500g and 1000g spool sizes in 1.75mm and 2.85mm diameter.
