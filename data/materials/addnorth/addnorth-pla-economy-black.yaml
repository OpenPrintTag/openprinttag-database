      All-round, easy-to-use PLA filament
      100% corn-based PLA
      Best value for money (1,000g spool size)

  Add North's PLA Economy is an easy-to-use filament at a very low price point. Produced with the same high quality as all our other filaments, but with fewer added color pigments to reduce production cost. Made from 100% corn-based PLA without any nasty additives for a pure printing experience.

  PLA Economy is a filament that we recommended towards beginners, because of its easy-of use and trouble-free printing experience. It's also a very popular material for prototyping and covers a wide range of needs for the hobbyist. 

  You can print functional parts for indoor use with PLA Economy, but be aware of its low wear resistance and don't exceed a working temperature of 60degreesC.

  For additional printing advice, check out our cheat sheets for recommended slicer settings in Cura, Simplify 3D and PrusaSlicer.

  Our PLA Economy, together with all our other filaments, are made in Sweden and have a diameter tolerance of 0.025mm.

  PLA Economy is available on 1,000g spools in 1.75mm diameter.
