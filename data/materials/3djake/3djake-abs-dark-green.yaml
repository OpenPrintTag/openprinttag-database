  3DJAKE ABS has been specially developed for industrial applications and the production of components exposed to high mechanical stress. It features high process reliability and outstanding material properties.

      High thermal stability: Ideal for applications with high-temperature requirements.
      Electrical insulation: Suitable for use in electronic and electrical components.
      Flame retardant: Complies with UL 94 HB standards and offers additional safety in critical applications.
      Excellent layer and bed adhesion: Provides smooth, robust surfaces without cracking or warping.
      Low shrinking and warping: Improved fluidity enables a stable printing process.
      High mechanical stability: Particularly suitable for components exposed to high stress.

  This ABS filament offers the perfect balance of stability, safety and ease of use and is therefore ideal for exacting industrial applications.
