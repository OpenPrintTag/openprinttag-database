  The easyPETG Matte from 3DJAKE is a modified PETG that has been specially developed for technical applications that require mechanical strength and a high-quality, matt surface. The silky matt texture minimises distracting light reflections and ensures a uniform look.

  Properties at a glance:

      Matt finish for a clean look: the matt surface visually reduces layer lines, conceals small imperfections and minimises reflections.
      High toughness & resilience: Compared to PLA, easyPETG Matte has a higher impact strength and breaking strength. The material retains its shape and is suitable for components that have to withstand mechanical stress.
      Temperature-resistant for exacting applications: The filament can withstand higher temperatures with no problems.
      Low warping: The material composition ensures uniform and warp-free print quality.
      High chemical resistance: The material is resistant to many chemicals and is therefore ideal for functional components that are used under challenging conditions.
