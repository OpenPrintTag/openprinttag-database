  In the realm of filaments, PETG is one of the most popular and widely used filaments. In contrast to the generally popular PETG, PCTG has better properties: They stand out due to their higher toughness, impact resistance and clarity, which makes them an excellent alternative to PETG filaments.

  The PCTG from 3DJake is a first-class filament, which is also characterised by high chemical resistance, a wide printing temperature range and long durability. The PCTG is easy to process, its texture stronger, harder and clearer.

  The filament contains no bisphenol derivatives (BPA-free) or phthalate-based plasticisers, making it even suitable for food contact.

  ► Wide range of applications:

      Domestic appliances
      Houseware
      Food and beverage packaging
      Cosmetic packaging
      etc.
